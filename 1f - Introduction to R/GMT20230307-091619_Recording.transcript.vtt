1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:17.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there we go. What's that saying? Recording in and prior to that, what about 5 years in police and children's social care doing child protection data and bits and pieces around that.

3
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:29.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, personally, really reading, really, really, really passionate about getting away from Kpis and using things like operational research and date, and to improve our services.

4
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:56.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: My day's science journey started. I think it's providing some data for Shaun for a dementia model he was doing, and then we got chatting. Then I think, I went on, excel course with Dan to do some very basic queue, modeling and geographic analysis again, all in excel with amazing, amazing nested if match statements that went on for about 500 miles long.

5
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:10.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which was, which was fun, I i'll start to dig out that training again. It's support. For some reason they don't do that anymore. But anyway, and so going on, that was really really fortunate to get into the second Hsa.

6
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:29.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We're really really open by my eyes, much much further into sort of operational research, and and that science. And last year I I completed my masters in healthcare day science at the University. So yeah, really, really keen on on data, science and all the cool stuff. And hopefully you guys are, too.

7
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:40.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've been using our for about 3 or 4 years now, very much coming from sort of a a, a sequel and excel background.

8
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:53.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I use price for a fair bit, mostly with the Hsm. A. And Msc. But my day to day love is definitely within our for sort of just general operational reporting, especially

9
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if you're still coming from that sequel, excel background, it's it's

10
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:16.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: probably makes a little bit more sense than than python. But obviously you guys are all python is so where we I spray. You probably got time for your icebreakers. But yeah, if you can just give us the long number on your credit card, your mother's maiden name and the free figures on the back. That'd be a good little icebreaker to put in the chat

11
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.000
other than that. If you could put in the chat

12
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:36.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: very briefly, Your current knowledge of our any of the scripting languages which i'm assuming most of you is quite some. But if you have any excel. Also we'll see cool advanced itself, etc., and

13
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:56.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: possibly, although this probably might be for sort of later on, if there's any sort of specific areas of things you got to us to cover. But I think we're going to go over that more at the end of the session, because I think the next session we can make it a little bit more hopefully. Get a bit more time to be a bit more fluid around that sort of outputs and what we will. What to do

14
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:08.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: can't guarantee that we can so obviously cover everything within 2 days. But hopefully, maybe I will sign post you where to get additional support or resources, or or further training, if you need him.

15
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:18.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got quite a packed itinerary for you, but we will take comfort. Breaks throughout. This is very much going to be so hand on teaching along a cod long training.

16
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:38.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There will be gonna be some elements where we're sort of code together. Copy what's on the screen, and you know hopefully an opportunity that for you to sort of test out what you've learned as as we go on. So, you know. Just try to make sure you've got some free access to sort of 2 screens, one showing what's what's going on there on when I share my screen and obviously your own screen.

17
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:58.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I will try to keep an eye on the the chat. I think I have actually got that my screen, so I can see that coming up. That's probably gonna be the preferred method of shouting at me, or the alternative method of shouting me is literally shouting at me. I didn't assume you guys can come off me and just shout.

18
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:08.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: otherwise I will just wobble on for hours and hours and hours. So yeah, do, shouts You put stuff in the chat. I think I can still see it whizzing by.

19
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But yeah, and if there's anything really really urgent, then. Yeah, please literally do shout.

20
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:29.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So. Yeah. As I said, this is, I have no hands on, sort of as you go along. Many of the lessons that build on top of each other. So if your code is doesn't work or you get stuck.

21
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: please please shout.

22
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:51.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because you know we don't want to be sort of left behind, and then the next bit is not going to work, and in the next bit, so just make sure you are up up to up to speed at all times. If you are really really stuck, then, you know, be prepared to sort of share your screen, and we can. We can have a look at what's wrong, and hopefully as a collective, see, see what's happened.

23
00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:07.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Obviously everybody learns from mistakes. So if everybody makes lots of mistakes, we can all share our mistakes and learn from each other, which obviously improves all of our knowledge. So please make lots of mistakes, and please share them with everybody else that we no doubt lots of common common things.

24
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:24.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You guys have obviously the loads of python. So at least you hopefully, you've kind of got over a little bit of that hurdle around case sensitivity. I know. When I started learning sort of programming languages I the python, and especially coming from a sequel and excel background. Microsoft teaches you

25
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: terrible habits of the case sensitivity, and

26
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:44.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully that won't be your biggest hurdle. But I know it. It does kick people quite severely, especially when when they're starting, and that's probably all I've got to say as an introduction, so

27
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:52.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we will be using our studio cloud. I will just pop a link to that in the chat, which is.

28
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if you haven't already. Please

29
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let's see.

30
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:19.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: please, log in, if you can. Essentially, all you need is a Google account, and you should be able to log in as a as a free. User we're not going to be using any sort of collective thing. We're all gonna be using our own accounts. I we're gonna be setting up as we go, just to

31
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:37.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to make sure what what's what? If anybody is using their own personal downloaded version of our studio, there will be a few bits that are tweaked and a slightly different for you, but I will assume that you're using the cloud version. It just means that we're all using exactly the same version.

32
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:51.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because I know, especially if You' using your Nhs computer, then. So version control. And who's using what becomes really, really, really quite a challenge, as I'm: Sure, you've all encountered. So

33
00:06:52.150 --> 00:07:03.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: out further ado, let me share my screen, which is that one there isn't it. and I want to show

34
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: down there.

35
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I got it

36
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that'd be good

37
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right. Say. that

38
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that should be showing. Okay, so introduction to, and

39
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:59.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's a general agenda. This isn't exactly the agenda we're going to be following. We're going to be tweaking that so you know that one.

40
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:12.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So course aims definitely. I just show you some of the possibilities, show you how it sort of all works, and hopefully give you enough that you can then go on and find some further further information. If you want to carry on doing some.

41
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so what can I do? It can do some useful, elegant graphics and sort of

42
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:36.059
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so various different ways. And there's some really really nice plotting modules. And we're gonna be sort of building up some so quite basic blocks today. But obviously we will try to make those a little bit more interesting. It can be sort of beautiful maps and some of heat, maps, etc.,

43
00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:49.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: obviously doing scripting languages, is all about sort of collaboration definitely about reproducibility. And there's also sort of the on markdown. So I've got this lovely interface with our mark down and

44
00:08:49.840 --> 00:09:06.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: quarter, which allows you to sort of create your analysis a little bit like a due point to notebook. But then to actually produce a a a final output which is got all your sort of charts and tables. They can be sort of interactive, and you can still have drill downs, etc.,

45
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:31.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and they can then sort of go out as an interactive standalone documents. So you can create sort of really really nice reports and sort of send those over to us as as a standalone interactive document, which is a really really powerful thing to be able to do to sort of pull in on your data. Do we wrangling, create all these and create a a report all in one sort of reproducible way.

46
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:49.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Obviously, lots of so automated reports. There are sort of a plugins for sort of dashboards, and you can sort of use dashboards, and you can use shiny to make so much more sort of interactive dashboards link up to service and have a more sort of traditional dashboardy thing, if that's what you wish to do.

47
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:57.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And there's a couple of the very, very basic examples there you can link. Your are up to sequel.

48
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:10.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: obviously mileage, and that varies depending on where you are, and how your specific type of warehouses are set up. But you can link directly through to Csql database, which again makes it that sort of really nice one stop shop

49
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: inclusive. There is a fantastic our community.

50
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:32.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Obviously we are part of the Nhs. Our community, which is a very much a community based around within pretty much Nhs. So push promoting that. And obviously there's things such as a conference, etc., and a a very active slack channel.

51
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:55.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The course philosophy. I remember this lovely cartoon when we were doing our train, the trainer trying to work out what this means, but what we are trying to say is, we're not going to go. We're not going to start the basics, and then, you know, go right through and build your sports car, and everything in between is not going to be useful. So we're not going to be ending our day with them with a sports car.

52
00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:14.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What we're gonna do is build up, and have already really sort of modular way, bit by bit. But hopefully, as we go along our journey, each little stage of our journey is actually quite useful, and we'll help us go that little bit further and and and faster. So again, that's a really really useful thing. So course philosophy.

53
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.340
Chalk, Daniel: So I

54
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:29.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, hello! Sorry just sergei.so that something come up the chat. Is there any way that you can mute your team certifications? I think a couple of people.

55
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:43.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: How do you don't ask me? That's no just just closing it, because if we recognize that you're on another meeting

56
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:51.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I put on, do not just that that might help. My yeah. People have said, do not disturb, apparently. That's I'm doing that now.

57
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry it's

58
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so. Now where is it?

59
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:14.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No, it's all right. I'll get back to teams in a minute. Sorry about that. Course. We'll say very relaxed and informal. That's me. All the slides, code, etc., are sort of going to be available. Let's put that on a

60
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: do not disturb

61
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:25.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Bang

62
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right hopefully. That will show up.

63
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:45.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and just Gemini, as you say, it's You've had lots of days in Python, and i'm sure you'll sort of have lots of experience in that. Obviously there's going to be a very limited to what we can get through in in a couple of days.

64
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:50.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's begin. So this are an our studio.

65
00:12:50.640 --> 00:13:20.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: obviously our programming language. Our studio is so for application. So sits around that no doubt you guys have to be using. I don't know what you've been using actually, either Vs code or or spider or something like that. So obviously you've got your You've got your You've got your call language and obviously you've got a nice gui. That sort of sits around it and does nice things, or if you've been using 2 python, 8 books, etc. So us you day it's just there to sort of really really help your

66
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:39.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: your your primary series. So our is your sort of stripped down rule piece of a a thing, whereas our studio is much more. We got your airbags, and you've got your satin, and you've got your indicators and lots of really nice things to sort of help. Make your driving experience that a little bit nicer.

67
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:45.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So generally we're gonna be using our. So we don't need to think about so far as a separate thing.

68
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:58.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that's that. So let's get into our studio. so we should have I' it cloud.

69
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I should be able to make that. Now louder, larger. That's the word.

70
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and Let's log in.

71
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm gonna look in the giggle. So I've already called Giggle accounts.

72
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.550
That's me there.

73
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Please shout if there is any problem so far

74
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:41.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will come up with a workspace. Yours will probably be empty, mindful of mess.

75
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So once you get to that stage you want to click up here where it says new project.

76
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I give you minutes for people to catch up.

77
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that was simply going into our posit

78
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully. You've already got an account, and you just log in with your Google credentials

79
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:18.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and where you go, and it should bring you to a workspace. And yours is probably here all empty, and I definitely need to get rid of some of my

80
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: please shout if anybody's got any trouble at that stage.

81
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Nope. I'm not

82
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: cool.

83
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Actually. Oh, yeah, Look at that. I can put my chat somewhere else.

84
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say, clever

85
00:15:48.400 --> 00:16:02.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is where is it on Github? Is it there now? Yes, it is, and i'll I'll put the link in at the break. So, hey, hopefully, everybody is there. So if you go on to New Project.

86
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:15.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it will give you a couple of options, and we want the our studio project. There is an option to start a 2 price project if we wish they wished, and you can use our studio.

87
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:31.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so i'll see you being the gui you can use. I'll shoot you to do pythony stuff if you like the the and also you can sort of Link Directory to a Github repository and sort of build stuff for there. But what we are going to do is a new project.

88
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that should start loading and deploying.

89
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it should do something very shortly. There we go.

90
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:17.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if anybody's used spider before it's very similar to Spider, and it's a initial look

91
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:24.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: or a little bit like, yeah, it's more like spider than it is for.

92
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:31.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So there we go, right.

93
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.420
This one

94
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say we've got Austria.

95
00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:49.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got several different bits. We've got a console, and where we can just basically it's a straight console window. 3 to our. So we can do some very, very basics. We can do

96
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: one plus one.

97
00:17:52.430 --> 00:18:03.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I will use this amazing potential to tell us the answer to such things. I do believe it is traditional to do a print.

98
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I well.

99
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we get a hello world.

100
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Everybody got a anybody not got to. Hello, World Stage

101
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.100
that's good.

102
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:55.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's very much about. We sort of put a command, and it comes out straight away and comes up with an answer. obviously. And i'm sure you guys are way beyond me that actually, we don't want to write

103
00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:09.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: our code line by line. We wouldn't like we. We want to make ourselves a nice script that will run through, and obviously have a nice bit of reproducible script that we can then share with other people. So we want to

104
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:17.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: choose create an our script. So up here on the top right hand side. Actually, just before we start

105
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:23.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: going much further, i'm just gonna make my stuff a little bit bigger for you.

106
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Where are we?

107
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay? So I hope that's a little bigger. But up here there's a little blue. I'm sorry

108
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:50.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: color blind green, plus. which says new file. If we click on that one.

109
00:19:51.870 --> 00:20:07.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it gives us various different options of different files that we can create, and what we want to create is an script. So it does give us a various options. I just sort of read for this quickly. There's a quarter document or quartet presentation.

110
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:37.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's if we want to create a report which basically that's where I was talking about. So we'll create that sort of standalone type report which you can then sort of share, and you can either set in that as a document, or you can create some presentations which again, sort of all interactive. And you can change through the training slides which i'm. I'm. Sort of showing at the moment. Those are all written in in so far quarto and a mark found to sort of flick through them and see what's going on there. You can use it in our notebook, which is pretty much a version of t pronate book.

111
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:51.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You can use our mock down, and there's various other bits and pieces, and we can obviously do different price pipes and scripts, and all those other different bits and pieces, but we want the top one, which is a very, very basic.

112
00:20:52.220 --> 00:21:00.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Our script. You can also could dress, control all shift, and and as a shortcut and create us a

113
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.170
script.

114
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So this is the editor. This is the console.

115
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now we can do one plus one. and press enter. and

116
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:26.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: seemingly nothing happens, however, if we want to actually send that line to the the console, we can either press.

117
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:37.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: control and enter, and it will run that script, or we can sort of highlight over where we want to go, and we can do our run.

118
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will also run our script.

119
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:51.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I think it works in a very similar way to Spider. I can't remember what Vs. Co. Does, but I think it's for all very, very similar, so i'm sure you very, very used to sort of running script

120
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in in that way.

121
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:09.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So obviously the most important command that you're gonna learn is the hash command, which is how we write comments. So this is a comment.

122
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:25.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Obviously comments are not evaluated when you run your code they are there. A. To just have a an idea of what's going on, and they're also there for future you to reach back when you come back to your code to try to work out what you've done.

123
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:34.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I know for a fact that future Simon is a complete idiot. So I have to write him really, really well documented code

124
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:47.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to try to explain what i'm doing, because when he reads back he's like, what if he was past Simon down here? He thinks past time is in as yet. But you know that's that' me now, and that all gets really really confusing. Anyway.

125
00:22:47.840 --> 00:23:07.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Teacher Simon is definitely an idiot, so I have to write him lots and lots and lots of comments about what's going on, and I would fully recommend that commenting is free and doesn't. Pick up any a thing, and it's just a a fantastic thing to do. So just comment your code as as much as you possibly can.

126
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:22.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Nobody is going to go. Oh, no, your code was far too, commented, and told me far too much of exactly what was going on. You know that's never going to be a thing. So comment your code as as best you can is really really good advice.

127
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.260
So we've got our editor here where we're writing our script, and we've also got a console.

128
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:38.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just a few things that we are going to change. So if we go back into our tools

129
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and global options.

130
00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:47.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there's a couple of bits and pieces that are worth noting.

131
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:55.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So one of which is our workspace, which is this one here.

132
00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:09.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So those are very useful, but also very dangerous thing. This is last shoot you. So when you save your what it can do is can take a snapshot of your environment as it is.

133
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:21.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and save it, as is, which means any data that you've loaded, any variables that you've created. All of that is saved is as a sort of a snapshot, which is

134
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:35.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: kind of really useful when you want to sort of, save where you are, and then come back to the next day. You don't have to sort of reload in all your data, etc. It's all safe within this environment, and you can just carry on exactly from where you are.

135
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:51.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The danger of that is, and especially if you're doing that sort of more sort of tweaky trade when you're doing lots of tests and trying to work out when you got something really finicky, and You're kind of trying to test something, and you come out with Look, you start making all your

136
00:24:51.850 --> 00:25:04.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: test variables just to I've got to try to do it this way. So this is my way of doing it. Version 10, that didn't work version 2 or that didn't work version 3. It was close, but it's in the wrong format, and you create a

137
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:17.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: This could just be me. But you then create this like great big, long list of random variables until you finally get to the one that's kind of done the all the all the table that you want, and it's not. Yeah, that one's worked fabulous.

138
00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:36.090
and then i'll build something else off on top of that and on top of that. And then you realize that actually you've created all these sort of temporary bits and pieces that actually Aren't included in your script. You've just been. I don't know, messing it out with things. And then when you come back to rerun the entire script.

139
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:47.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It won't work, whereas if you've got it saved in the workspace it, it does so. It's kind of good practice to click on that and turn off that saving.

140
00:25:47.960 --> 00:26:00.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It does mean that you have to load in your data sets each and every time. But it just means that each and every time you are working fresh, and it's running through your code. And if there's any issues in your code

141
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:19.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you'll not still continue where you've sort of broken something previously. I say, I've I've done it many a time when I've created a sort of a temporary test version of a a of a function. It's what I' i'm now copy that into my main code and just copied it wrong. And and the one does something weird. But yeah, anyway.

142
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.640
The other thing that to do is the appearance

143
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:32.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as well as I said. I've changed my font size there to be bigger. Some people like sort of dark.

144
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:44.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: various different themes, etc. If you wanna sort of a more dark theme, or or whatever obviously choose something that makes makes it more comfortable for you

145
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:56.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: personally, especially when I was doing a lot of our, and I was doing a lot of python at the same time. I always always program our dark text on light background.

146
00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:13.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and when i'm doing python, I do like text on dark background. But that's just me. It just helps differentiate in my head. I do pay for now. All i'm doing are now because i'm sure as we go on, you'll find out they are similar, but different

147
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:24.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in many many different ways. So yeah, feel free to change the appearance if you say wish. So next thing is talking about our packages.

148
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh. that's because Python missed the chalk, sir.

149
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

150
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:39.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry. Did we? And tick the workspace you saw option? Yes, we did. just because it's good practice. It's not a problem.

151
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:51.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's just it's just good practice, I mean, sometimes, if you you working with really really big data set, you've done a lot of analysis, and you just want to go to bed, and you want to come back in the morning and have it sort of where you were.

152
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:57.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's fine. It's just a little bit dangerous, that's all. So packages.

153
00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:12.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so packages or libraries, as we call them, are like apps for your phone very much. I'm sure you guys have been using pandas where you hopefully have to import those. The Our version of those is is called a library.

154
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:26.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: exactly the same as in Python that we do and install install a library, and then, when we want to use that library, we can call it so. The the equivalent of

155
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:45.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the the equivalent of a a pip install is an install package, and then when we want to cool that library, we do that as a library command. So we're gonna be using something called the tidy verse. So again, there's 2 different ways. We can do an installation. We can do it

156
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in case

157
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is installed. Packages.

158
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Tidy this.

159
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: or you can go to tools.

160
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: install packages.

161
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:10.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will come up with a massive long list when we start typing stuff.

162
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:16.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we can find the one we want and press tab

163
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then press install.

164
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:28.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So i'm gonna do it this way, just because it's got the install dependencies already clicked on it. And that's probably. Why so if you go up to tools.

165
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:35.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: install packages and then find tidy verse and then press install. This is gonna take

166
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a couple of minutes to chug through.

167
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's just to confirm tools.

168
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: install packages at the top an entirely by.

169
00:29:50.740 --> 00:30:06.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and again very much like a python, where you do a pip install. Sometimes some packages or libraries depend on other packages and libraries. So having that install dependencies, just calls in everything

170
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:13.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that all the different bits works, doesn't work. Let's just try that again. So you've got in 2 tools.

171
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: install packages.

172
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then you should have

173
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: tidy.

174
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yes.

175
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then install.

176
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Is that working to go.

177
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:49.090
sygal.amitay: Yeah, I think it's done. It's just telling me it's not doing anything, and then it just did it.

178
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:55.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It then sometimes is a bit of a lag on that I don't know. I guess it's got a

179
00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:10.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I don't know, I think, because it's we're on the cloud. It's gotta go through various bits and pieces, so that's installed the package a bit like when you do a a pip install, and exactly the same as we would within

180
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I then we were then what's cool?

181
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:21.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That one? We would would cool our library if we want to use it.

182
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Big difference between. So we can just do library, 20 verse.

183
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:37.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it should come up with this big difference between our and python is that now

184
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:43.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we've called that library. All those commands now are just in our sort of base, our

185
00:31:43.640 --> 00:32:01.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: environment or in our our environment. Now we can just straight use them. We don't have to sort of prefect them with like the Pd. Or the number an Mp. Or whatever we don't have to specifically cool that library in order to use that command. It's just there. Now, in our global environment.

186
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:19.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There are ways to specifically call a a command as especially just to explain this. But here is that sometimes, if you calling in lots of libraries. Sometimes there's conflicts around certain verbs or or names of of things

187
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:25.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: where they've obviously 2 different libraries are using the same command. So, for instance.

188
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

189
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:34.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's exactly what Alex is saying there. So yeah, you can specifically call a a a.

190
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:52.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if you've got 2 libraries, both have got a select command, and you want to specifically say I would use the select command from library. X. Alex. Has told us how to do that, so when we load in. This is giving us a warning that we've got a a conflict here

191
00:32:53.020 --> 00:33:11.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that there's a sax package which she's got a filter, and there's a deep layer, which is also got a filter. We are using the conflict. So by default we're using filter, and that's masksing stats filter. But if we wanted to use the stats filter. Then we could

192
00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:21.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: puts that, and then 2 codons, and then that filter command would be the one from the stacked library, and not the tidy.

193
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it I just get rid of that.

194
00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:44.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say the installation of the tide diverse, or the the library. You only need to do once. You would with it. Pip, install. But each time we want to use this command we've got to cool that library into our script, and then we can use those those commands.

195
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:53.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so that's required on every session, every script. So within the

196
00:33:54.290 --> 00:34:03.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've we've directly here, just on installation from cram. So cran is the comprehensive. Our archive network

197
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:22.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: contains about 19,000 packages or libraries. They're all free. They all peer reviewed, which is a really really important part of the the Crown Repository. So any library that wants to be submitted into the

198
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:31.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the Crown Archive has to go through various different hoops to make sure that it meets has some unit tests that that is

199
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:59.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it, that it works that has certain sort of a level of help, files, and v. Yet some examples of how how things work, so it has to reach quite high standard before it will be to be a a emitted on to to cram. There are loads of those of Obviously, there's sort of 19,000 packages on there of around, sort of interactive graphics, dashboards, machine learning, twitter, mining, Powerpoint creation of documents and and

200
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:14.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: maps, etc. There's also other repositories where people haven't put stuff on to crown. So there's a lot useful packages which is more so. Development packages which you can find on Github. So you can sort download a a lot of packages from Github

201
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:20.520
and and there's also our open side, which is sort of peer-reviewed. I never

202
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:38.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: peer-reviewed ecosystem of our packages, which is also got to sort of various bits and pieces on there, one of which is a a fabulous sort of finger tips package, which is, uses the sort of Uk Hsa data. And a really really nice do we to pull that data through if you want to use that?

203
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, so

204
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:48.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's basically libraries and and and and obviously

205
00:35:48.330 --> 00:36:07.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: installing and using libraries, we will be calling in some other libraries as as we go along, and we have to install those. But i'll see at the moment what we've done is just pulled in the tidy, so the tidy verse is, collect a lot of the most popular our packages into one.

206
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:24.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And what's really really nice about it is that they all share the same sort of underlying principles, so that they provide simple tools with a pretty consistent structure, which you can then sort of use together to sort of solve pretty pretty complex problems really. So what

207
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:35.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the works during the workshops we're going to be using a lot of tide of us. We're going to be using duty plot 2, which is a sort of fabulous plotting system.

208
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:51.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We're gonna use a Dp pla, which is a a fantastic sort of data manipulation sort of syntax to be able to do some filters and grouping and and sort of aggregation, etc. And we're gonna be using the radar package

209
00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:57.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is basically just reads in Csv and and excel sheets, etc.

210
00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:10.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So those are all bundled up just within the tid of us. And, as I said, it's, it's it's quite nice in that. They also follow that similar syntax. So they all play nicely, really, really well.

211
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:26.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that is the very, very basics. What we want to do now, though, is something a little bit more exciting, and actually get some data and do some stuff with it. That would be that would be good

212
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:29.400
just to

213
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just to

214
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:50.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So so just going back a stage because I forgot to mention it when we first started. We have the open blank workspace, and then we created a new project. Obviously, we're using the cloud. So it's just created a project within the cloud. And this is our our project area.

215
00:37:50.880 --> 00:38:08.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: When you do it on the desktop. Your project basically just creates a folder for your your piece of work that you're doing. The real beauty of that. Is that all your work, then, is contained within a single folder. So if you want to

216
00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:23.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: put any data in there, so any sort of Csv sell sheets, etc. They all go into that folder Any anything you save will go into that folder, any output, documents, etc. That you create will all go into that specific folder

217
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:30.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which means it's just really nice. It's all keeping everything self-contained and then you could there's

218
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:50.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a high level. Our project file where you can save that entire project, and then share that with somebody else, so that they, you know, whole thing, can do all, all the settings and everything all goes with it, and you can package up really, really nicely, which again makes it really really nice. So so collaboration and sort of sharing, etc.

219
00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:57.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's what we've done there. We've already created a project. Even then we didn't know it

220
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:10.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: within our console up here. We've so at the moment we've got an untitled project. If you want to, you can click on that, and you can change the name of our project.

221
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I didn't know what training

222
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will be there.

223
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:35.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we've also got our details here. So if we were working within a desktop, we would have a folder here with some.

224
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:45.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you know, with whatever we've got saved in there, as I say to. So let's just save our starting script, because it's always good to save your work as you go along.

225
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

226
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let's call it training script.

227
00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:04.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can now see that saved here within our folder. So this is just a you know, a an a a a file. It's Laura essentially on on this section here.

228
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:24.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What we want to do is import some data into our folder because we want to use those in a moment. So at the moment, obviously, if we were working on desktop, we would just save our files into the desktop. We're using the cloud. So we're gonna have to import our data up into the cloud.

229
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:33.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I believe yesterday all, although on the smack there was a zip file with some data sets in there.

230
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hopefully. You've had an opportunity to unzip it. If not.

231
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you can do so now.

232
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And also.

233
00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah, put them somewhere where you can find them

234
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so. I believe this I should remember fitness. 5 files.

235
00:40:53.170 --> 00:41:04.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and what we want to do is upload them so that we can put them into our virtual folder. so we want to click on the upload and then his file.

236
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:18.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let's take it forever. I very slowly put mine on the desktop.

237
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:31.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and where are we? We've got beds, a a bed state to capacity. Ae: and then these Tb. Cases TV new cases. Yeah, I'll go through that in a just a second.

238
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's the I plan.

239
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then I upload is here on the middle, right up here.

240
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:50.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, sorry. I don't know if you've clicked on something, so it should default onto the files. Tab.

241
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:59.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go. So you have got various other types which i'll go through in a minute.

242
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But there's files, uploads.

243
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: choose file.

244
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and

245
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the one we want.

246
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:23.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Fortunately I don't think it lets you.

247
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:39.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There is an option. It does say about uploading a zip, file. So not tried that. Actually, I don't know If you can just upload the zip file, and it it does say it will automatically expand it after upload, so you might get to just download upload the entire zip file.

248
00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I don't think he can do multiple my account.

249
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:51.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so it's 6 files. I think we want to upload

250
00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:56.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it works. Look at that fabulous.

251
00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:04.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, if you want to be one of the cool kids, you can just upload the zip file in one go.

252
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Well, my on.

253
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:31.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So this is, as I said, just the equivalent of putting them into a folder that we can get to.

254
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I thought she would have to upload them first, just to make them available.

255
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If we were using desktop, we would just be copying and pasting these 5.

256
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yes, that's right. Yeah.

257
00:43:51.570 --> 00:44:01.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's correct. Yeah, that's data capacity. A case is new table and pop. Sorry, My, my mistake. I think I've got an extra one for

258
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: some unknown reasons.

259
00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So you should have 5

260
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Csvs.

261
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:40.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So this puts everything into that nice project folder.

262
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:57.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What also means that you can then swip switch between if you're working on different projects, or you just want to load in, You know, a piece of analysis to do with a specific project you can just load in that project.

263
00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:07.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it's a really really good way of staying, organized and keeping everything all in one place to do with a specific piece of work

264
00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:26.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is really really nice to that so built in as default. Otherwise everything ends up in your I don't know a folder, and you've just got a gazillion things of very, very messy. And it's that very, very hard to keep up with version control and and the various bits and pieces.

265
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:49.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, so our projects definitely make it easier to sort of organize your files and and your workflows. You can sort of switch between projects that makes it easier, and also means. Then, if I want to share my project with somebody else, or you know, get somebody else to do this piece of what kind of off to somebody else. I've written this thing

266
00:45:49.010 --> 00:46:05.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you can then then just say, it's all in this folder, and they can just open up the project, file and everything they need will just be there rather than sending somebody, you know 5 billiondifferent links, etc. And you need to pull this in from here, and that in from there, and I etc.

267
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:14.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it's definitely recommended for so all tasks, big or small, to so put your stuff into nice projects.

268
00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

269
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:23.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if we were using, if you want to create a a new project, if we were starting off from there.

270
00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:27.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is it possible to move files between projects. Yeah, Absolutely.

271
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:38.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's: yeah. So since you've put something in, so a a project basically sets that as your default area.

272
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:53.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so you can move something into a a different project. You can copy it or or move it across. You can explicitly tell to say things or load things, and you can give it a so a file path, and it will follow that file path

273
00:46:54.510 --> 00:47:05.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: by putting something in the project just means you don't have to do that. It ultimately defaults the the whole file path to where you've created the project, which again just makes things really really easier.

274
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:11.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And it means, if you lift and shift the entire project. You then don't have to

275
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:24.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: change all of your file paths to your stuff. It will still sit within that project. So if you listen to shift the entire project. I will still know that this is a project, and it's, and it's here.

276
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:31.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So again, that just makes things a lot lot easier with the you know things that suddenly change, etc.

277
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:41.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we wanted to create a new project, we can.

278
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry.

279
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

280
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:50.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no, i'm not doing it so.

281
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, it's different on our studio. Isn't. It

282
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:57.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: maybe something.

283
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, okay, that's that in a minute, right? Anyway.

284
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:10.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So definitely use projects for your work we are now at half past.

285
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:17.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so has everybody got the 5 bits of data in there?

286
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:40.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hopefully, You've got your 5 sheets in there. If not, gives a shout. It's half past. Now let's have a quick 5 min break. Just so I can go and grab some more coffee before we go on to the next. Bit. So yeah, let's have a 5 min breaking sort of come back at what? That is. 25 to 11

287
00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:52.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and i'm gonna leave it recording. If anybody's got anything desperate to show up, pop it in the chat, and i'll come back in a couple of minutes and have a look at that hopefully.

288
00:48:52.580 --> 00:49:01.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully, you've all pretty much got what I've got on the screen. If you haven't pop it in the chat now, and i'll come back to you in the 2 min after I'm grabbing coffee.

289
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:23.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, it's 25 to

290
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:27.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I am hoping you're all back

291
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:32.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hands up if you're not back that doesn't really work, doesn't it?

292
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, just there on save

293
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:45.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We are now going to import data, because obviously that makes things much, much more fun when we've got some later.

294
00:54:45.400 --> 00:55:01.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So there are various different ways. We can import data. As I said, we can link up directly to SQL. There. We can download zip files. We can link directly to

295
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:13.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sort of the urls and download data from that. There's a fabulous somebody

296
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:25.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that there is a fabulous package which allows you to sort of copy and paste data. So you can have a like a data table in a in a

297
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:28.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What's the word? Pdf.

298
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:45.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you can sort of copy over it and highlight it, and then paste it into our, and I will convert it into a data table also does that for word as well, which is properly clever. But we're gonna we're gonna cover some real basics and just load in some some basic Csvs.

299
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:53.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But yeah, that there are some really really amazing ways to import data in, and of very different ways.

300
00:55:53.240 --> 00:56:08.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we would like to import the capacity Ae. Csv file. So we could write that code from scratch, or there is a little bit of a import with it which we can use to help us.

301
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:14.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and i'm all for being lazy and getting wizards to you do work for us.

302
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:28.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So open the top right hand here what we've got various tabs. I'll go through some of what these bits do. Further on as we go on. But basically in our environment we've got one here that says, import data sets.

303
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:31.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we click on that.

304
00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:39.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we want to import a data set from text using. Read our.

305
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:43.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it's the second option down. So it

306
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:49.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just to confirm again, environment import data set second option down. Read our.

307
00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:59.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it's telling me I need a an updated package. Do I want to sold it now? Yes, I would love to.

308
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:06.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm assuming you've got all the same.

309
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:15.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but that installs very quickly and just. That's once, and then it should bring up a a textbook. Sorry a new window such as this.

310
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:21.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can then click on our button

311
00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:28.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and look for our capacity. A. E. Csv. Which we should have here

312
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and open.

313
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:41.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will give us a very quick preview of what our data looks like, just to make sure it's right.

314
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What's also quite nice is that

315
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:57.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's given us a bit of code preview. So as we go through, what we could do is every time we run our script, or we try to do this bit of project, we could go into the import wizard.

316
00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:08.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: do our bits and pieces, and then we have that data to work with. However, that's really really dull. We're all like scripting. What we want to do is is, write some script. so what we've got here.

317
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:20.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh. but somebody in the wing right? What we've got here is a code preview for those who've just joined our with through this again in just a second, just to make sure everybody is up to speed.

318
00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:27.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got K. Prev. So we can just do a copy of that. So just control C or right click and copy.

319
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:33.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And then if we cancel. and then we could just paste that into our script.

320
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:44.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And that will do that. So for basically just cool up, just come in on our environment. We want to go to import data sets

321
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:47.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: from text, read.

322
00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:55.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then brows find our capacity. Ae. all right time.

323
00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:06.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It will give a come up with a preview. We could just press import there, and it just import the data set. But we don't want to do that. We want to copy the code

324
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:17.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is over control, c. Or we can do right, click and copy and silver, and then paste it into great.

325
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:23.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we could just run highlight over there and run.

326
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:29.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that will do a couple of things for us.

327
00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:39.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as everybody got it to do that as anybody go. Anything weird or different.

328
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: anyway. No, Grover.

329
00:59:50.440 --> 01:00:02.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: all good, excellent, excellent. So what it's done is in a new tab up here in our in our scripting language we've got a copy of the data.

330
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:12.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we just having a look at it. You can click up on the on the top, and you can just do a very quick sort of the data

331
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:21.540
which is quite useful just to getting a little bit of an eyeball with what we've got. If we've got any any any issues with it.

332
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:34.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can just close that tab, and it will get rid of that. We go back to our training script. So just running through the script what it's done it's, then it's, it's it's, it's it's it's in the read our library. It's

333
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:45.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: done a read Csv of that Csv and it's put it into this object called capacity. Ae, and then we've viewed our capacity ae, up here in our environment.

334
01:00:45.260 --> 01:01:02.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We also now have some data, and so it's telling us we've got a a data object called Capacity a, which is 68 observations of 5 variables, and there's various different things we can do. So one of them we can run a view command.

335
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:04.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we just want to run

336
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:17.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that command and run again, that will put it up in this in this viewer, and we can have a look at our data, and it's just literally seeing it.

337
01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:25.690
You can do that same thing by just double clicking on the data on the top right hand side, and that just creates a view here.

338
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that also lets us have a look at what's

339
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:35.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can also click on the Little Blue Arrow to the side of our data.

340
01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will give us some information about i'm a data.

341
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:51.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So our capacity ae, is the name of our of our data set, and then we've got a dollar sign, and then we've got these, which are our column names. So if we look at our

342
01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: oops.

343
01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: thanks to

344
01:01:55.710 --> 01:02:04.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we see we've got These are our column names, which is the equivalent of capacity at all assigned sites. We'll reference that

345
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:22.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: got section there selling it. System numeric. We've got some attendance data here, which is also numeric. We've got a staff increase which is a true false, and that's come through as a a logical data type. And then we've got some other details here around deep queue calls and the wait

346
01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:27.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Is everybody got that? And then we can close that up again.

347
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:30.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There are some quite nice.

348
01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:36.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say, yeah, that's just. and that they to

349
01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:38.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to

350
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a

351
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:46.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and

352
01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:01.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and also double click

353
01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on that.

354
01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:13.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What's the rules between library, lower case and view? Upper case?

355
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:29.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. Things. Aren't: always consistent. So because lots of different people write lots of different packages, Not everybody sticks to the same naming conventions. So.

356
01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:35.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as we can see, we've got a read Underscore, Csv. As a. As a function here.

357
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:49.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: however, for whatever reason the person who created the view function decided it needed to start with a capital V. They don't quite understand why, but that's what they've done

358
01:03:49.660 --> 01:04:03.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is very naughty. We also have some commands which are separated with dots so so full stops, and we also have some crazy commands which are in

359
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:12.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's a camel case where you have capitals in the middle of words and things, and August really, really tricky.

360
01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:15.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, that go away.

361
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:26.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, sure, now i'm supposed to be somewhere. Why, if I sorry I just realized I was supposed to be a meeting. I better say I can't make it

362
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry about this.

363
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:51.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry, My, that's so. Another way that you can also get to your view of a small work works. Anyway, that is very strange. Don't know why that is.

364
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:58.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let me just I mean, obviously, you have me booked in for me. Yeah.

365
01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:00.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: said yes, but

366
01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:11.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry about this. So another way that you can also do a view is that you can press control and then click on an object

367
01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:24.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: name, and that will also bring up. So you can press control and capacity a. A, and that will also bring up the view of your data.

368
01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:36.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is really really nice, especially when you've got a quite a long piece of script, and you want to know where you are With a. With a where your data is, you can back. You can

369
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:37.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so

370
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:42.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and click on

371
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: day today.

372
01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Use command. If you are on a Mac

373
01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: object.

374
01:05:53.610 --> 01:06:01.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I will share my code that I'm doing now for you as at some point.

375
01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Why is that doing that? Alright.

376
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:17.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Thank you.

377
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:31.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you do the right click to the it's not right. Click! Hold control, and then click on top of it.

378
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let me just move that out of the way.

379
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:40.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so you can hold control and then click on

380
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right?

381
01:06:54.340 --> 01:07:07.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay. So we've got some data in. We can do some really, really simple things to do, some exploratory data analysis just to work out what we've got here

382
01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: an account spell.

383
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I definitely cannot spell today.

384
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:39.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we run a summary function on our data. Let's just sorry for that. Say, you can also move the window sizes and mess about with those, if you want.

385
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:43.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it will just tell us

386
01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: some basic data about

387
01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:54.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: about our data. So it just the very simple mid Max medium quarters.

388
01:07:54.990 --> 01:08:05.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if you've got any n as it will tell you how many you've got in your data as well, which is just really really useful to try that. Try to understand what your data looks like.

389
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:14.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hmm. Excuse me, right? So we have got some data in.

390
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's do something with our lovely data.

391
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:37.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, so we've got some data. Let's do something with it, and see if we can understand what our data is.

392
01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:50.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and hatefully try to answer a bit of a question and do this amazing thing called some analysis. So what we're gonna do, we're gonna plot some of the data to try to answer ourselves a question. So

393
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if this decides to wake up

394
01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:56.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there we go right.

395
01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:06.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we are going to do some plotting to try to answer that question. So we're gonna have a go at Gt plot to.

396
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:31.319
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So this does cover a lot of stuff which is in the the fabulous book i'll call off the Data Science. There will be a link to lots of these books and and resources at the end will so show you where all those are. They are absolutely fabulous. You can buy a a paper copy, if you say, wish, or there are free, open source, available

397
01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:35.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: book down versions or interactive books available online. So

398
01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:44.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: all the training resources and all of these books that we'll be using. We've taken bits from are all absolutely freely available.

399
01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:51.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So Gt: plot is one of several plotting systems within our a bit like.

400
01:09:51.670 --> 01:10:12.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I suppose, in Python you've got seaborn and mat plot lib. So Gt. Plot is the the the equivalent of of those it's the the mainly the one that is mainly used. There are other other systems are available, and i'll use for different things. So plot the is fantastic for making

401
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:34.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: well, just plots really, however, and I don't know if you've used it. I think you possibly might have done a little bit of plot the when we're doing so, forecasting and and things like that. So plot the you can use then to sort of make interactive plots with so hover overs and drill downs and and so clever things, and i'll touch on some of that in the next session.

402
01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:41.130
So why is it popular? All of those reasons Gt. Clock works

403
01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:53.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in a similar way to Mac. Not live, as far as I remember my matl lip. Sorry in that. You sort of build up your basic clock, and then you just add layers and layers and layers to it.

404
01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:08.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if you know you want to sort of change any anything on it, you can, you know, adjust those bits and pieces. There are some sort of fabulous themes available. BBC: Use Gg: Pl. To to use that to do a lot. Their graphics.

405
01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:21.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So Gtp block 2 is a an a typical part of the tidy verse. So we've already loaded in the tight diverse in our script. So we don't need to do that that's absolutely fine.

406
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:32.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So our first project we're going to have a look at we're going to look at a a perennial challenge, not a perinatal challenge, as I often say, for the Nhs

407
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:48.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: pressures in the a. And e I mean, I don't know who bre this is. Is that a thing? Anyway? We got a lots of demand, and we got some capacity, and we got some ambulances, and we've got a little man here. I don't know what he's doing

408
01:11:48.710 --> 01:12:04.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: anyway demands and capacity problems. So the data set that we've learned loaded is our capacity a. and it shows the changes in the capacity of a and E departments between 2,017 and 2,018.

409
01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've got objects called capacity ae.

410
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that's our data frame, or what we call a data frame.

411
01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:28.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What is a data frame? So a data frame is well, a frame of data where we try to look at it. It's. It's always tabular data.

412
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:39.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So in tidy data each variable forms a column, and each observation forms a row, and each cell is a single measurement.

413
01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:44.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Probably either later, today, or possibly early part of next session.

414
01:12:44.900 --> 01:13:04.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We will look at how we can look at long data and wide data, and so convert them from one way to another. But yeah, you've met. Had the wow that is properly to be have is a sorry to be saying they've met heavily with him. Did he have his trademark go time?

415
01:13:05.690 --> 01:13:07.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I hope so. Yeah.

416
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:14.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: He did have his bedtime fabulous. He's a very, very well known, very, very clever chap.

417
01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:31.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I will go on to some resources at the end. But one phase is something called Tidy Tuesday, where basically they just get really really clever people in the world of our. Give them a a completely random data set, and then say, Away you go! What can you do with it? And

418
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:37.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there's nothing better than seeing, like happy with him who pretty much built the tidy.

419
01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:55.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: doing, just writing, spanning mistakes, and doing like the really basic, not putting the commas in the right places all those really basic areas that throw you every time. And it's like happy to be doing that, too. And it just kind of all makes almost makes you feel human, anyway.

420
01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:09.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we will be using something called a data frame. Technically, what we will see is something called a tibble. But for what we for for all we are concerned about, we we would

421
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:29.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: basically working in data frames. I mean, I guess you guys have used python. So you're aware of the difference potentially, between that you get sort of a a raise and you get series, and you get. I remember there is come on the panda is called the Data table. So i'm trying to remember now what it date frames.

422
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:32.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So you've got all these different

423
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:51.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: potential data types of of of things. But what we're going to be using is is you pretty much bog standard data frame of and yeah, it's that's what we're gonna be easy, for here we are going to be using a few vectors later, but i'll. I'll explain that when we get to them. So, viewing the data frame we've

424
01:14:51.500 --> 01:15:02.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: done all this already. We've had a look at it. What we want to do. Oh, sorry! The other thing I didn't mention, which was quite a nice little feature is that

425
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:09.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: when you have got your data frame on screen. you can click on this little button here

426
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which spits it out into another window.

427
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:35.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's a little bit slower on the on the cloud, for some reason. In fact, mine's going really slow, but it puts it out onto another window, and that's really nice, especially if you're sort of working with that, and you want to chuck it off on to another screen so that you can do stuff and and look over to it. And

428
01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: i'm trying to remember what your column names are, etc., and also

429
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:54.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in that view you can do some really sort of basic filters as well. Just so, if you want to check what your data looks like, totally gone, often attention as but on Simon. So we've had a look at our data frame.

430
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:56.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can also say.

431
01:15:56.790 --> 01:16:01.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just run our our data frame, and it will print out

432
01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:12.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: ahead of it into the console. So let's just run. So instead of doing a capacity, a a a summary of capacity, a. If we just simply write

433
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: without spending mistakes.

434
01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:19.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, my computers don't see the

435
01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: capacity a.

436
01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:40.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: A. And again, this is got really really nice also for you. So you can just press the turn or or tab on on what you want. and that will also fill. And it also obviously does that for commands it also does it for.

437
01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:49.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But for data, as you go on and create objects which is really really handy. So if we just simply run that, so I just press control and to. or you can

438
01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:54.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: run that it will then just give us a view.

439
01:16:54.380 --> 01:17:02.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It will tell us that we've got a tipple, which is 68 times 5, so that's our 68 observations of 5 variables.

440
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:14.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it would just show us the so, the top 10, as it were, and tell us what they are. And it also tell us what our data types out, which is quite useful, and it will tell us

441
01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:31.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that we will that we've also got 58. More. Rose, and it would just give a little bit of information that if we wanted to see more within the console here that we could do a print, any calls whatever to see more of those rays if we say wished. But we don't want to do that.

442
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:32.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry.

443
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:43.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Do we understand the variable names? What do they mean? No, I think it's the short answer to that. So let's go through those sorry

444
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:52.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at the site that just gives an Id number for the site. So we've got. However, many is 68 individual

445
01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sites.

446
01:17:54.670 --> 01:18:00.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got an attendance number in 2,018,

447
01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:18.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so how many attendances they have in 2,018. Then we've got a logical which is a true or false. Did the South numbers increase between 2017 and 18? So if there was a staff increase. We've got a true and obviously, if there wasn't a staff increase, we've got a

448
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:33.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we've got the difference in average between the twentieth 17 and 2,018 a for the numbers of cubicles available, and also the numbers of weights.

449
01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:37.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry that the time of of waiting. So we, on average, wait.

450
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:54.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what we're trying to see is by increasing. The staff has that had an effect on on the waiting times in in effect, and is there a relationship between the numbers of attendances, the numbers of queues and and weights, etc.,

451
01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:59.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which we are going to do? A nice little bit of visualization to try to answer those questions.

452
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:01.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

453
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:07.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah, we can do a nice bit of visualization. And

454
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:09.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Mr. Turkey well.

455
01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:14.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that it's just so. It's how great

456
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:25.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry our question is, is a change in the number of cubicles available in any associated with a change of length in attendance.

457
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:27.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say.

458
01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:37.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let's start. So we're going to do a plot, and what we want to do is plot our numbers of cubicles against our length of attendance

459
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say we start off with a. Gg. Plot

460
01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:45.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is over to us. Now.

461
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's just

462
01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:51.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: well that pretty nicely there.

463
01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:52.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say.

464
01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's yeah.

465
01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: nothing.

466
01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Gg.

467
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:01.020
plot.

468
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:07.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And the first thing we want to do is tell it what data we want to plot

469
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and our data we want to plot is our

470
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: capacity. A.

471
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:18.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say hopefully, that's relatively straightforward.

472
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:26.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The data that we want. The plot is all in our capacity. Ae.

473
01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:28.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: objects.

474
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:38.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Next thing we want to do is add some layers. So we add layers with the plus sign.

475
01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:46.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So this is where we start getting a little bit different from our friend Python.

476
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:54.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but also quite similar. So in the same way. Let's just do something completely different over here.

477
01:20:54.700 --> 01:21:09.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So in the same way as I would do you kind of. If you want your command to go to the next line you need to end with your comma or your plus or your You need to keep an open bracket, so it knows to go to the next line

478
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:13.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: for a Gt plot. We use the plus symbol

479
01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:24.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to say that we want an extra layer onto our data on to our plot. In some of the software doing. Later we'll be using pipes and and various different things.

480
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:36.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what I want to do is give it some X and Y coordinates that we are going to go through. So we want to use a G on point

481
01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:41.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which basically tells us

482
01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:43.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that we want to do a a sketch graph.

483
01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:50.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then that's sorry. Let's go back to that.

484
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That you copy it out there and then.

485
01:21:53.700 --> 01:22:07.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There are certain things that we want to put in our our G on point, and those are called the aesthetics, the main to aesthetics that we need to know for our point. It's X and Y coordinates.

486
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:16.790
We can also feed in, and we will do later on things like size of the point color of the points, groupings of points, etc. But

487
01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:35.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: for but absolutely bog standard scat graph. We just need an X coordinate and a Y coordinates, and so we do an aes, and then another set of brackets, and then our X is our do you keep calls, and our Y is our d weight.

488
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:40.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I am going to cheat and paste that in.

489
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:43.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry.

490
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:49.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, man, that's not what to

491
01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:09.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so good of a difference from Python in that all doesn't care about indents

492
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:21.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: our likes pretty case, but isn't completely and utterly in then crazy. So it has automatically given me an indent.

493
01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:32.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I just run that, and we should come up with something like that. So it has given me an in. Then, automatically. However.

494
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if I really want it to be ugly with my cage.

495
01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:41.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I can do that, and it will still work.

496
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:44.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I can the

497
01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that.

498
01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:59.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will still work. and I I want it to be really evil. I could do that. and it will still work.

499
01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:09.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But we're not evil here, so we're not going to do that, so we can do a a return after our plus.

500
01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:17.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can also do a return after our comma here to make our our data. Okay, nice and readable

501
01:24:19.050 --> 01:24:19.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: they could be.

502
01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:31.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And i'm sure you would be aware that if always got to leave your sort of training commerce to go on to the next stage. So in this code this will work.

503
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:42.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: however. if I remove that one there, and have my comma at the front here. It's not going to work, I say yes, it will do, because I still got the

504
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this will

505
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:58.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: work because it's still in the in the brackets. But anyway, if it wasn't in the brackets, and I was splitting something out that isn't that it's gonna work very nicely, so generally. Don't do that.

506
01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:09.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, she has got some pretty good syntax errors there, and it's telling me that here i'm expecting a a comma off the expression. What she is exactly is. So

507
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:19.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there we go. Has everybody got a scattery plot that is looking like we've got a line of something

508
01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:22.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: possibly going on.

509
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:25.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yep.

510
01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:27.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I Us

511
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:37.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: cool, right? So that was my cool, cool, cool, cool. So we've got we've got a very basic plot

512
01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:49.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: of some description, and it looks like we've sort of got some sort of shifty sort of line. But what does that mean? Who knows?

513
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:53.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry that's explore it a little bit further.

514
01:25:53.820 --> 01:26:02.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So there's lots of choices about the chart, and we can also do sort of various things about it. And oh, my goodness me.

515
01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:19.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that pie charts some choices around things like. Obviously, at the moment we're talking about the aesthetics we've done things like changing the all we've done is an X and Y coordinates and everything out. It's just gone to defaults. We can change the shape of our data.

516
01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:32.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can represent what shape we can add different visual aesthetics, so we can change the size, the color, the position, obviously the X one access. Those are Us. Aesthetics

517
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:37.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: change the color. So

518
01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:43.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so at the moment all the size, shape, color, all of that is, is completely by default.

519
01:26:45.010 --> 01:27:00.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just to say that functions so things like the Gg. Plot, the Gg. Point aes are functions, and we've already used a couple of functions in our in our code already. We've done a a. Read Csv function. So if we go back to our code.

520
01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:02.680
which is somewhere.

521
01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:14.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can see that we've got these functions. We've got a view, and that's got a thing. So all functions are basically called by a function name and then brackets, and then whatever

522
01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:30.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: feeds into that function. So we've got a plot here, and then we've got brackets, and then it's asking for us data. We've got a G. On Point function, and again it's asking for stuff to go into brackets and and go through there. We've got our read Csv function here.

523
01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:48.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So all functions use bracket. So it's a function name, and then brackets which is worth knowing. So running a function does something. Functions are given 0 or more inputs. So sometimes functions Just have, you know, a load of stuff defaulted.

524
01:27:49.020 --> 01:28:12.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm: assuming you've done functional programming within your python and built your own functions. And yet you mess up so hopefully, you understand what what i'll see if I those are, and tomorrow or not tomorrow, next next session would do some sort of how to do sort, functional programming, etc., because we could do all that, and you can also use a classes within.

525
01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:16.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: although I do think I've got gonna have time today to show you that.

526
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:35.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So within functions you can explicitly name arguments. So we've done Gt: Plot data equals capacity, ae, just to make it really clear. But it's not necessary. You can use default. It will sort of go through the order of your data, and we'll pull out

527
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:50.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what what you put into the into the data. Personally, I find it really really helpful, especially for future Simon, because we've talked about him, and he's got he's got major problems is to actually explicitly tell your your

528
01:28:50.520 --> 01:29:10.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: put in there what what your what your data is. Same with our X and Y coordinates potentially. If you wanted to, you could do why first, and then acts which could potentially be confusing. So yeah, don't do that. But you potentially could.

529
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:27.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However, we could also say that our X and Y could refer to the default values, so we could do is Gc. Plot past the ae, and then G on point, it would assume this is X, and that that is why.

530
01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:44.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just because that's the order that X goes first, and then, and what goes Second: so it's not always necessary to name arguments. I just personally find it really good practice, especially because I know what future assignments like. So sometimes

531
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:51.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: something like X and Y. That's quite easy to work out what those are. If there were additional things going into that

532
01:29:52.080 --> 01:30:03.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: into that function, it becomes really really tricky when you're trying to unpick what you've done about, and what you know. What what are you feeding into that thing? So I find it much easier to

533
01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:06.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: explicitly say what i'm putting in there.

534
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:15.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So Gyms John's describe the plots instead of the it's you's may use, so there are

535
01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:27.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: lots and lots and lots and lots of different types of jobs. We're going to explore a few others in a in a bit. But there are. There are jobs for absolutely every type of plot you can possibly think of. But obviously

536
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:51.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a couple of basic ones. Here we've got lines and box box and histograms and stuff. And what's really nice about them is that they all work off the data and say things like a box plot. You just feed in the data, and it will work out all the all the stuff for you. Things like histograms. I think we'll do some of them a a bit later, but you can just sort of feed in the data, and then sort of tell it how to bin your data for your histogram.

537
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:57.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You know it will do that for you, whereas if you've ever tried to do like histograms and box box and excel it's an absolute

538
01:30:58.490 --> 01:31:00.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right now. save

539
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:12.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at the moment we've got we've we've laid it and jumps. So what we want to do now is add another job. So we've got our nice

540
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: ish.

541
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:24.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I say, nicest it's really ugly plot. We've got our really openly plot. But what would be really nice to do is if we can add in some sort of smoothing line or trend, blind to

542
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:35.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to help start trying to answer that question. And you know, can we actually sort of see a a a trend that is getting on there. So let's add, in

543
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:37.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a tread line.

544
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:48.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So again, really really simple to to add in there, and it will do the hard work for us. So we want to add in a G on smooth.

545
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:56.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we've already got our to on plot. There. Now, we've got our G on point, and then we want to add in a smoothing line.

546
01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:01.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's go back to my code here.

547
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:08.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm going to do it separately. Just so. I've got

548
01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:13.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's maybe 9.

549
01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:20.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Us. you know.

550
01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sneeze.

551
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:28.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then copy those again.

552
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:33.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No.

553
01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:56.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as everybody got a wibbly line on their data.

554
01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:07.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so what that has done is added in no who who hasn't

555
01:33:07.690 --> 01:33:09.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: collect.

556
01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:16.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's have a look. Work out what we've got so same as before.

557
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:27.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We need another plus at the end of our G on point, and then we want a G. On smooth. and then exactly the same.

558
01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:33.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And if we ask our problems, collect, we got that fixed.

559
01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:44.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You Haven't got it, either.

560
01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:53.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, didn't put the plus in.

561
01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:59.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry. Just just run it through again. So we've got our original plot.

562
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:07.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got up to that that we want to do a plus at the end of it, because we're adding another layer.

563
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:09.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we would our team.

564
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:12.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Smith.

565
01:34:15.170 --> 01:34:21.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we want our aes, and then more brackets. X equals, d

566
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:27.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: he? Because

567
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:32.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: y equals the

568
01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:33.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: wait. So

569
01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:45.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if you got an error message past it in the chat.

570
01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:52.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yes, we can even, and we will come to that in a minute

571
01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:01.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: quite often. It's best to show you the long hand, and then we can show you shorthand.

572
01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But yes, we will. We will.

573
01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:13.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It also means that potentially we can unexpected symbol in

574
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:23.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: D White. Is that the full? Yeah, our message? Have you got another

575
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:29.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: should have 2

576
01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:34.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: closing brackets, because we've open up to.

577
01:35:51.130 --> 01:35:56.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Is that working now, Phil? Anybody else? It's very hard, probably easy to shout. If you can come off mute.

578
01:36:00.190 --> 01:36:04.310
Phil Debenham: No, it's not working. I'll paste my code in the chap.

579
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:06.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, okay.

580
01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:08.700
yeah.

581
01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:17.070
That's good

582
01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:22.880
Phil Debenham: bizarrely enough. It's now worked.

583
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:33.750
Phil Debenham: That is very weird, so it wouldn't. It wouldn't run when I highlighted it. But doing control enter has made it work.

584
01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:35.920
Phil Debenham: It's good.

585
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:47.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay. I mean quite often I go and do things like that, and try to run it. which is very, very cool, all right. So hopefully it's Got a whiply line

586
01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:57.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just to go through a couple of little nice bits about against of us today, but it tries to do is when you're next to a

587
01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:08.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: bracket we'll try to highlight the the matching bracket, which is really nice, especially when you get into those lovely nested commands of of doom.

588
01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:23.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So again, if i'm if i'm next to that one, it will tell me, but the matching bracket for this one here is that one there. There is an option in the global options that you can set your your brackets to rainbow brackets, so it color codes them.

589
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:37.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and so it tries to allocate them across, and then you can sort of try to match by color again, which is, which is quite nice. Take, excel, does that which is quite a nice little feature. I'm not going to do it. Hicks, the Pant doesn't share very well on on

590
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:46.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a free zoom. And that stuff I've had feedback for. But i'll usually do that, and also makes your code super super pretty, which is quite nice.

591
01:37:47.160 --> 01:38:03.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So there's that. So what we've done now is ultimately fitted, using a a lowest model which is least ordinary estimated. Some of squares off the top of my head. I'm trying to remember now

592
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:09.890
something like that. So basically it's a it's quite a funky, smoothing line

593
01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:26.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: where it uses a sort of formula a bit similar to a K means, and it kind of sees what's near it, and then tries to create a a, a a, a line based on what's near it. So it's quite a good fitting liner. However, it can

594
01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:37.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: massively over fit to outliers and and do some weird things, but it kind of looks at what's close to it, and then tries to make a a wiggly line based on that.

595
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:39.280
However.

596
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:46.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can also fit different types of lines to it, which I think we are going to do.

597
01:38:54.570 --> 01:39:04.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, we've come out with that. And if we want to, we can add a a linear line to it which will just be a fox that did linear regression. So let's

598
01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at

599
01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:15.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so copy your data. Again.

600
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:24.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I like to copy your code again. Sorry. And basically we just got to feed another

601
01:39:26.690 --> 01:39:32.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: feature into our G. I'm. Smooth we want. So

602
01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:45.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this is where it gets a little bit complicated when you're first starting out. So the aes is the aesthetics for your actual dots and your charts, or your line, or whatever.

603
01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:55.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so anything that we put within this aes sub set of brackets would affect all the dots, submit, and bulbs and pieces.

604
01:39:55.750 --> 01:40:05.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Our actual smoothing line are not to do with these dots and that sort of calculated separately. So we want to create a separate.

605
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:18.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We want to tell it to do something different than what we do so we're gonna change the model that we're using. So in between the 2 ending brackets we want to add in

606
01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a method

607
01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:22.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: equals L. M.

608
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And in in in speech marks.

609
01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.960
and i'm going to make it pretty by moving that.

610
01:40:33.650 --> 01:40:34.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

611
01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let's change that tab

612
01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:41.430
amazing. I so now

613
01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:47.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that will give us a linear trend line rather than a smooth tread mine.

614
01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:55.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because our is super cool at stats.

615
01:40:56.630 --> 01:40:58.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can also.

616
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:04.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to a what we got. The

617
01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:09.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The

618
01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:13.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: my Oops

619
01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: account spell.

620
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:27.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's a cool trustee.

621
01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:40.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can create ourselves a very quick

622
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:41.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: linear model

623
01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:43.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: of

624
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:56.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: data so sorry that's not included in there, and that will pull through our coefficients and our statistical significance and residuals, and all of our

625
01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:03.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: all of our lovely stats on our linear model. If you are so inclined to

626
01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:19.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the main one that we're interested in is that our 3 little asterisk is here, which shows us there is something significant going on between

627
01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:21.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, and yeah.

628
01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:26.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: not going to explain all linear modeling stuff for you. Now

629
01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:34.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say what is happening, what and what is happening here. Say.

630
01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:36.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry.

631
01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:42.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That is the tilde sign, which is shift hash on a normal keyboard

632
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:51.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: next to your return key. Sorry I should have. That is a bit of a weird one that we use shift to score a tilde.

633
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:55.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And yeah shift hash

634
01:42:57.470 --> 01:43:03.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that is on my keyboard. You might have some weird Mac keyboard or something. I don't know

635
01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:17.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully that comes through cool. So we've got couple here which appear to be not like the others.

636
01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:28.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: A bit of outline. Say. let's look at our hypothesis. So we've got 2 sites that have seen staffing increases.

637
01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:36.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what we want to do is say what we can do to our graph is if we map the color

638
01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:48.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: based on the staff increase. We' to highlight which of those sites within our data set here has seen a a, an increase. So

639
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we want to go back to

640
01:43:53.010 --> 01:44:02.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it So that's load. And let's copy our data in again.

641
01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:18.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if you're doing this all on one that's absolutely fine, it's not a problem. So we want to now add a we want to color our dots in, based on our staff increase. So we just remember our data. Again.

642
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:20.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if we have a look at it.

643
01:44:21.850 --> 01:44:32.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we've got a staff increase which is basically a a true or false. So we want to color all our true ones in one color and all our forces in another.

644
01:44:32.770 --> 01:44:43.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've got our G on point here, and we've already told it. It's X and y coordinates. But now we want to give it another aesthetic to say we want to change the color

645
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:54.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so literally we can do it comma and then color a cool stuff increase.

646
01:44:56.350 --> 01:45:12.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so now, depending on whether it's a true or false, it will color them in by default, one color or another color. So this sits it within the aes, because we are changing a feature of the dots.

647
01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:25.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if we want it to color them all, something we could color them, but our color would be outside of the aesthetics, because it was just doing something across the the board. If we wanted to change the shape of them globally.

648
01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:34.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Then we would do that outside the if we wanted to do it based on something, then we include it within the so I would play with that in a minute.

649
01:45:34.450 --> 01:45:37.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now, if I've added color to my graph

650
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: pew.

651
01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:49.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can see right for me relatively clearly that our sites, which have had

652
01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:52.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: an increase which is this one, this one.

653
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:57.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this one. and this one, on the whole.

654
01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:07.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: have seen a reduction in their weights. We, obviously these ones are, are also still a little bit high, but I don't know what they were

655
01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:18.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that you know we don't know what else has been going on with those, but on the whole we do appear to see a difference. If we wanted to, we could. Let's just

656
01:46:19.450 --> 01:46:24.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: have a mess about a little bit, and let's have a little bit of a free form. So

657
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:31.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what we could do instead of color, we could change that to

658
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:40.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's Sorry. That's my number.

659
01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:53.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, we can. We can block, and we can do a size based on this thing. I'll give telling me off here

660
01:46:53.730 --> 01:47:06.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the warning message. That is just a warning that using size for a discrete variable is not advised. Yeah, it's probably right, because that's really really ugly.

661
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:14.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If we wanted to, we could change our I don't know our size, based on

662
01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:18.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: numbers of cubicles.

663
01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:26.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and if we wanted to let's put it outside and we could do color

664
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:28.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oops.

665
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:33.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it goes right.

666
01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:43.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say my size is based on my d cubicles now. So as I bought, i'm expecting to see as

667
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:47.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as we move to the right, the dots should get bigger.

668
01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:58.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've put my color outside of the aesthetics and told it to be red, which should just then make all of my dots red globally.

669
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so let's have a look at what that looks like

670
01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:16.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: ghastly. But I hope you get the point. So everything there is is hopefully changeable. I mean, you can potentially

671
01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:31.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: add in you change it to sort of the shape, the the whatever you can. You can have tweak with those to do various different things. It's. It's a very recent thing that asked you to has done recently to tell you

672
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:44.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what color is and what red is in case you didn't know. You can also put it in hashtags for hex, hex colors.

673
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:52.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is also really really useful. If you want to stick to the Nhs color scheme, and very specifically use those.

674
01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:55.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We will come to that in a minute.

675
01:48:56.650 --> 01:48:59.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So so we've done that.

676
01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:03.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

677
01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: done size. So again, if we wanted to

678
01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:19.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: make our size global. Then we would stick it outside. If we want it based on something we can. We can make it based on a a feature.

679
01:49:20.110 --> 01:49:22.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Well, we got

680
01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:41.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so to answer evenings question. So to avoid duplication, because we're all really really lazy, and we don't like duplicating our data, our coding, because, you know, we've got poorly fingers, and we don't want to

681
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:48.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: have to type in x equals y equals. And then again and again

682
01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:04.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can put our a. As within our Gg. Plot, so let's

683
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:08.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: take it out of there

684
01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and put it in our Gt.

685
01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:27.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we've moved it there and then we can also now remove it from here.

686
01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:43.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If we want to convert back to a lowest model, and not even plead anything into our G on smooth. it would literally be like that. And likewise, if we didn't want to specify our color.

687
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it would be

688
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:48.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: like there as well.

689
01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now running that

690
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:53.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oops

691
01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:59.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: using size aesthetic was the

692
01:50:59.140 --> 01:50:59.750
Yeah.

693
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:07.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it has worked. It's just telling me off. I should be using line with oh, okay, that makes sense.

694
01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:23.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because i'm feeding the same thing. I'm: feeding this size, keep it to my G. I'm smooth my GM. Smooth doesn't like a size doesn't make sense, so it's given me a bit of a warning.

695
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:26.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but that's fine, or just remove my size.

696
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:36.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go. It will stop winding, I mean there.

697
01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:43.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so what you can do is just feed it in once, and then just

698
01:51:43.410 --> 01:51:51.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: those bits will just feed into your point, and you're smooth. So if I did do my, if I did what to change my color.

699
01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:57.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm sorry my size equals

700
01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:59.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the

701
01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:03.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if I spell that completely.

702
01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:04.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Strangely.

703
01:52:08.850 --> 01:52:11.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I could feed that in there.

704
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:18.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I it won't feed that for that.

705
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:23.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No, I have to be. I have to pull a whole lot through.

706
01:52:24.970 --> 01:52:26.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, don't do that.

707
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:29.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay.

708
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:35.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, if I wanted to be lazy and not feed it into every single

709
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:37.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: part of the plot and feed that free.

710
01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:49.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What that does mean. If you do, do it like this method, then you can obviously pull through different layers, and you can have your smoothing based on

711
01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:52.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: different Xy's coordinates, if you say, wish

712
01:52:53.030 --> 01:53:07.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: definitely, definitely, definitely recommend not not plotting like 2 different charts on 2 different scales onto one plot. It is possible, but it's really really hard, and

713
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:23.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the reason it's really really hard is because it's utterly nonsense, and it's really really bad visualization practice. Never ever ever plot to things with separate scales on the same plot. It's really really really bad visualization practice

714
01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:25.850
the amount of horrible

715
01:53:25.930 --> 01:53:38.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: bar charts with floating line charts over the top of them on a different scale. To try to show some sort of correlation between things just makes me makes me

716
01:53:38.010 --> 01:53:57.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: makes me makes me sad. So don't do that it's really really bad practice. If you want to do a correlation analysis. There are statistical ways of doing correlation, analysis, plotting 2 things on top of each other and going. They vaguely go up and down a bit is not how you do correlation analysis. So please don't do that.

717
01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:07.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's do some magic. So what is a really really nice

718
01:54:07.730 --> 01:54:14.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: other little functions that we can do is small multiples.

719
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we are all going to.

720
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's it magic.

721
01:54:26.230 --> 01:54:29.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let's just get rid of allg on Smith. And now

722
01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say. just going back to here.

723
01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:44.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: back to our basic plot.

724
01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:57.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What we want to do is add in something called a facet rep. So back to the basics, and i'm able to add in facet rap.

725
01:54:58.810 --> 01:55:03.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we want to use our tilde button, which is our shift and hash

726
01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:06.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: stuff.

727
01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:08.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and

728
01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:12.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then

729
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:14.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully run that

730
01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:26.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and what that will do is basically tell it that we want one set of data. But we want to create a separate

731
01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:39.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: charts based on a separate variable. So in this instance we've got stuff increase, which is basically just got a true and a false. So now we've got a chart for our trees, and we've got a chart for our forces

732
01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:52.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: where this becomes really powerful. Probably in some you more today. Day work is, if you've got several teams or several regions or or systems, or where whatever level you're working at, or

733
01:55:52.210 --> 01:56:03.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you want to use that same data set, but facet it across the teams across the regions across the treatment functions or whatever. So you just create. One day it's that one plot, and then you can create

734
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:06.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: all the subplots, all in one go

735
01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:18.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is super super fantastic. So this example is just showing, obviously just the true and a false. But if we have extra additional things within that within that data set.

736
01:56:18.850 --> 01:56:27.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you know, we could. We could build up absolutely huge amounts of lovely facets across all the different things, and it means that

737
01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:37.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you know, we can also avoid those horrible spaghetti charts where we just plot all of the teams on one plot, and then we can see them

738
01:56:37.730 --> 01:56:53.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: by using facets. You know. It's definitely, you know we're not. We're not printing these things out. We're not keeping trees anymore. Let's have one plot per thing. And then you can actually do a proper side by side comparison rather than trying to unravel spaghetti.

739
01:56:53.410 --> 01:57:06.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Not a fan of spaghetti in in in plotting. If we wants to. We can obviously add various. You know all of these things are, or or or changeable, so we can add our non call

740
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:08.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: equals one.

741
01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:18.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will put them up above each other if we so wish. And obviously we can specify Rose, and whatever

742
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:27.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I mean, if we wanted to, and I wouldn't recommend it. So we've got what we got. We've got a site Haven't, we?

743
01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:33.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, I mean, we could do a plot per site

744
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:41.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which, as far as I can imagine, it's gonna give us 68 plots with one dot on it.

745
01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:55.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So obviously don't do that because that would be really really silly. It's also going to take a little while to render, but it will come free, and nothing we can do is if we can click on the little zoom button here

746
01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:59.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which will ping out our zoom.

747
01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'll plot and we can. We can manipulate that a little bit to.

748
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:19.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But anyway, obviously that that's a complete nonsense because we haven't got decent data in there. But hopefully just sort of shows that you can create huge amounts of charts across various different things, really, really nicely, really, really, easily.

749
01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:36.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There are export options here just within our studio, if we wish to, so we can just save that as an image or Pdf. Or copy it to clipboard. We've got little broom here if we want to clean out all of our plots, if for whatever reason, a plot is having problems rendering. There's a there's a cancel button here.

750
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:44.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you can also flip through your plots. so does it. Let's have a look.

751
01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:52.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let's go back to. So somebody's asking, how do you make the gym smooth work?

752
01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:59.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what do we want? We want it on staff increases.

753
01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:08.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I forgot my plus they.

754
01:59:16.630 --> 01:59:19.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So those are definitely different lines.

755
01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:22.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I know.

756
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:32.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because that one's given it massively Huge confidence levels. Because we've got such sparse data.

757
01:59:36.090 --> 01:59:38.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: These are

758
01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:41.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

759
01:59:43.180 --> 02:00:02.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it scaled. Really, it's scaled really weirdly, because that's obviously it's it's expanded to show the confidence levels for this one. Obviously, at the moment we've got we're sharing a y access, but we can tell it that we don't want it to do that

760
02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:08.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: by. Okay, that's

761
02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:18.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: very good thing, so I can't remember all of the all of the functions for every single function. So I think we're gonna come to it in our next lesson. But we're gonna do it now.

762
02:00:18.650 --> 02:00:23.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Help. Help is always really really useful thing to be able to find out.

763
02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:32.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There is a help button here where you can do a search, and you can find a answers to different things.

764
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:39.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I find a really nice thing is that you can just click on a a a and then press f one.

765
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:50.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will now tell me how to all the functions and usage of the facet Rep.

766
02:00:50.530 --> 02:01:00.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it tells me these are all the H sorry here, where? So yeah, just just click on a something and then press f one.

767
02:01:04.230 --> 02:01:14.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So you don't you just click. So if I want it on Gg: plot, I would just hover just click my on to g plot if I want it on facet wrap, just click on, and then press f one.

768
02:01:15.130 --> 02:01:18.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now it's telling me.

769
02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:35.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yep, just getting back to that. You can also type into the console question, mark and the name of your function, and that will also come up here so it'll give me a bunch of options, and what I want to do I want to

770
02:01:43.110 --> 02:01:55.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that scales. That's it. So I want to have them on 3 scales. so scales any calls 3.

771
02:01:58.890 --> 02:02:00.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If I run that now

772
02:02:02.610 --> 02:02:15.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's, put them on different scales, because this one has, and then you can see a lot better what's going on there. You can set them as a free X scale, free, wide scale, etc.

773
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

774
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:29.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: does your G on smooth working now, hopefully, that makes a bit more sense. So you can see what's going on. But also, if I want it, somebody's put it in there Another way to get help is to just do

775
02:02:29.210 --> 02:02:30.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: now.

776
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:32.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I see it all right.

777
02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:36.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will also bring up

778
02:02:37.810 --> 02:02:50.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the the answer. And, as I was saying, as part of the getting approved, to go on to the Crown Repository is that you have all of these. What's also really really nice is that

779
02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:57.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: has some built in data sets, as in just some standard data sets, they're not massive. They just some little data sets

780
02:02:58.350 --> 02:03:14.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: built into our which means each of the each of these functions, then they can give you a reproducible example. So literally, I can run this, and I can do my find my Gt. Plot there.

781
02:03:15.220 --> 02:03:17.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I can just run that.

782
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:23.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I can copy an example out of the help

783
02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:34.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is really really nice. Still, feature that you can have a a reproducible example of right. Okay, this is it. And then you can kind of unpick it and hopefully get to to where you were.

784
02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:41.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is really nice, and i'll see this is just giving you a couple of different examples at different levels.

785
02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:43.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And

786
02:03:44.110 --> 02:03:52.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: oh, yeah. So if you want to change how the labels are printed, or changing the order that the panels appear, etc., etc., etc.

787
02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:59.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, literally, this has got an example of exactly what we had here about. How do we set our scales to be free

788
02:04:01.230 --> 02:04:07.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that we go? So again, the help functions within our are really really useful.

789
02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:22.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The other thing I find much, much better than Python is actually all the error messages. So I quite often find that the warning messages and the area of ever messages are actually quite useful.

790
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:36.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and if you're ever stuck, I definitely recommend just reading out the error message out loud to yourself because a lot of the time, it will actually answer your question for you, which is fabulous.

791
02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:42.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we took a little bit more, and then we will do some other bits and pieces.

792
02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:44.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

793
02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:49.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let's just do some very, very quick.

794
02:04:49.630 --> 02:04:52.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let's go back to our

795
02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:54.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: version here.

796
02:04:58.230 --> 02:05:00.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Make it pretty.

797
02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:10.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I really don't like the standard standard output. So let's just go back to what that one looks like.

798
02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:27.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go. So we got that. I don't like great backgrounds, and I don't like the grids. So there are ways, and there's lots of variables that we can just change the theme. So let's just do theme.

799
02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:36.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Minimal is my favorite, and i'm not gonna add anything else to it. I just gonna add on that plus fee minimal to the end.

800
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:49.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will just get rid of the black, and change a few bits and pieces if we want to. They're awesome. So if you start typing in theme and then under school oops.

801
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:58.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it will come up with a few other options. So it's been dark. What about the like?

802
02:06:03.110 --> 02:06:16.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But there are a bunch of themes. There are libraries of themes, so you can download like the, for I think the BBC. Has got their theme available that you can just pop it out. Financial times. It's got one.

803
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:21.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There is an Nhs.

804
02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:28.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There is an Nhs our theme which converts everything over to use, and it just color schemes as per standard

805
02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:32.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which you can get on the Nhs our github.

806
02:06:34.290 --> 02:06:47.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, but basically you can also set up your theme so that you can set up a theme for your team. So If you want to use specific corporate colors, etc., certain fonts, etc., you can. You can change that

807
02:06:47.710 --> 02:06:58.930
much as you can with se ball, one and a map. Pop lib. Everything on the chart is up for grabs about what you can change so you can change labels. You can change fonts. You can change

808
02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:08.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at the moment. It's gotten, you know, gaps of 20. If I want to actually be gaps of 10, I can change that if I want to be gaps of 4.7, 6. I can change that.

809
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:18.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: etc. in everything within that chart plot is is up for grabs. So let's just do some other quick plots. Let's do a

810
02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:23.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: histogram. I I can't spell his program.

811
02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:29.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we want to do a Oh, it's

812
02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:33.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: equals capacity.

813
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:41.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I can't spell capacity a a. and then i'm going to do a gee

814
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:44.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: histogram

815
02:07:45.810 --> 02:07:48.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in a Yes.

816
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:58.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because it's just a a I his scram. We only need one variable. So it's Just have a look at off the weights.

817
02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:00.610
I can read that.

818
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:03.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will give us a

819
02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:08.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: very quick and dirty Instagram.

820
02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:13.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it's told us as standard.

821
02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:18.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've given it. It's given it where we 30 bins.

822
02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:21.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If we want to, we can change our bin with.

823
02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:32.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And again, just on the fly it will, it will change our bins.

824
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:37.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is quite nice.

825
02:08:39.670 --> 02:08:43.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we can do a

826
02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:55.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I should probably

827
02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:02.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a boss.

828
02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:10.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yes.

829
02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:35.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so that should be an equal shine. Yeah.

830
02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:57.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that gives us an ugly

831
02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:03.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: an ugly bar plot.

832
02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:08.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What would be much nicer is if we copy that.

833
02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:16.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and let's make a an ordered version.

834
02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:24.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because if we're making bar plots, we should always order our bars

835
02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:30.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: unless we're using a Time series, in which case don't use a bar. Plot is a line plot. But

836
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:44.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so let's reorder our sites based on the attendance, so we can do a re

837
02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:54.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: order. and I can put that in another function. We want to reorder our sites based on the attendance

838
02:10:55.210 --> 02:10:57.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: 2018. And then

839
02:10:58.590 --> 02:11:08.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this is where it gets really, really really messy around commas and brackets because we're doing functions within functions and all of that joy.

840
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:18.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But then, apart from the bottom there

841
02:11:19.150 --> 02:11:30.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: with the site names. But we can now see what's what's going on there if we specifically want it to color in certain of the bars, etc., we can. We can do all of that.

842
02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:50.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you know. That's absolutely not a problem. We could change the color of the bar so that we got a gradient we can. You can set your own gradient color schemes to say that anything under 50,000 is gonna be a purple. Anything between 50 and a 100,000 is gonna be a

843
02:11:50.610 --> 02:12:08.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: move, and anything 100,000 to 150,000. It's gonna be green and anything above that, red or whatever. So you can sort of set your own specific color schemes, if you so wish. There are lots of really nice packages. If you want to do sort of color scales

844
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:18.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to say I want my starting color to be orange. I want it to end in purple, but I want a nice clean transition from there to there in

845
02:12:19.010 --> 02:12:24.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: X number of steps, so I want 12 colors between orange and purple

846
02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:41.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as a transition in 12 steps, and it will give you the codes for the the colors, and create a up to a smooth variant that also. I'm not gonna go forward to that now, because that's just making things pretty, but also pretty good. And again, if we wanted to add our fee minimal to our

847
02:12:42.070 --> 02:12:45.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: or whatever we wanted. I don't know

848
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:51.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's no idea what this All 2

849
02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:58.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: theme light, I guess lines up. Get you about a horrible gray background. And again, if we zoom into that one

850
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:08.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can obviously see that we have got our numbers in there a little. It's not. It's not quite as messy as it looks when it's all bunched up down here.

851
02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:22.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and obviously we can do so various bits and pieces with that. I'm very mindful. It's nearly lunch time, so we will just do another couple very quickly. Let's do a box plot.

852
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:29.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we want to do a Tt plot

853
02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:38.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: data. It cools goodness. May they tab a plus a please copy and paste it from above.

854
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:42.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Don't be like me. And right now, over and again again.

855
02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:47.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Capacity a a there we go.

856
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:51.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: plus she

857
02:13:56.610 --> 02:13:59.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we're going to see. Hey? Yes.

858
02:14:01.410 --> 02:14:02.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: stuff

859
02:14:04.070 --> 02:14:06.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: increase. How about d?

860
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:08.130
Right?

861
02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:31.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's just given us a box plot based on where we've got a true whether there was staff increase or that was a false, and the distributions of the weights. So we can see there wasn't a massive shift in the average. However, the actual distribution we can see it's much, much more skewed

862
02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:35.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this way, and we also appear to have

863
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:40.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: outliers on our weights. I gotta copy this one this time.

864
02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:46.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and let's do a

865
02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:50.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, you

866
02:14:51.570 --> 02:14:57.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: lynn. which is literally change the word box plot to violin.

867
02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:01.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go

868
02:15:02.770 --> 02:15:18.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and have a look at that, and then we can get a a violin graph of our distributions, which is basically like a density plot on its side and mirrored, but we can sort of see the shape very nice. Associate shapes of distributions.

869
02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:24.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Can't wait to.

870
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:38.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I think we can just copy that in there again.

871
02:15:49.330 --> 02:15:57.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and if we want to, we can add in the like individual. Try to put some data points on there to sort of show you

872
02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:09.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the individual numbers that we're talking about when we're talking about distributions. It's very easy to go. Oh, look at the distribution here compared to that distribution there. But we've only got

873
02:16:09.230 --> 02:16:18.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a handful Webinar distribution here. So just so. It's very easy to sort of layer up those sort of things, and if we want it to change the color of our

874
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:24.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: points, and this one going up, or whatever that's all. all totally possible.

875
02:16:27.670 --> 02:16:33.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's just do some quick tidy up of that.

876
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:46.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's just

877
02:16:54.940 --> 02:17:08.219
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so. Let's just make it a little bit prettier. Say, let's add some labels onto it, and again it's just that add, we want to change our title to something

878
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:13.969
Simon Wellesley-Miller: change in stuffing.

879
02:17:18.889 --> 02:17:21.309
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we also want to change our

880
02:17:21.430 --> 02:17:27.559
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Y access rather than saying waiting, but sorry de weight to something else.

881
02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:33.809
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I average waiting time. I for age

882
02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:37.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: my team time.

883
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:43.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry.

884
02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:55.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: quite simply. We just change. We've added a title. We've added a thing you can do, captions. We don't see if we want to. We can change our X axis and do all of those bits and bob's.

885
02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:01.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then. if we wanted to.

886
02:18:06.930 --> 02:18:09.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've made ourselves a nice little plot.

887
02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:16.549
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Can't see the previous line has it as a box over it, so I can't. Which bit are we talking?

888
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:25.049
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Which way are you stuck on to go?

889
02:18:27.629 --> 02:18:39.549
sygal.amitay: No. Just when you type? Then a box appears over and hides the the line before. That's all right. Have you got it now? No.

890
02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:41.510
sygal.amitay: I

891
02:18:42.129 --> 02:18:46.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: where. Where's it? Where have you got to? I can go back a bit.

892
02:18:49.799 --> 02:18:52.389
sygal.amitay: Don't worry. I'll i'll figure it out.

893
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:53.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay.

894
02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:59.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so say we've made ourselves a nice plot.

895
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:06.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we want to save it. We can just save it if we say wish

896
02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:19.379
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as so we could if we want to just click on the export here, or we can tell to save it for us. and we can just do a chichi save

897
02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:24.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no

898
02:19:29.070 --> 02:19:32.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Don't P. And G. Oops.

899
02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:36.139
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will just save it.

900
02:19:40.170 --> 02:19:42.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's just a No, I say

901
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:52.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what's quite weird and quite interesting that if we, if we save it, I see what you mean. It comes up with that. If we save it in this format.

902
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:54.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: save it like that.

903
02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:15.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, I'll get back to that then. That might, because we're on the cloud. I'll come back to that.

904
02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:30.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That that would work normally, and it would save it as a Png image. What's really quite weird is that it saves it in the shape and the format that you've got it within your window here. So if you've stretched it out here we'll have it stretched out there.

905
02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:43.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There are methods that you can sort of feed through to your Gt, save in order to specify the height and the Save Oops. Sorry. Sorry, Houston.

906
02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:53.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. So there are ways of specifically, if you want to tell it to save in a certain size and shape. You can do that.

907
02:20:53.410 --> 02:21:15.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However, what we're possibly doing either later, today or possibly next time around, is showing that how we can put our plots directly into output documents, so we can put them directly into sort of either HTML interactive reports or we can put them straight into a word, or or whatever, or Powerpoint, if we say wish.

908
02:21:15.210 --> 02:21:22.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. So there's no need to specifically, save in in a sort of in a plot format.

909
02:21:22.380 --> 02:21:23.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hey, Kitty

910
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:32.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: any questions vaguely on plotting, I mean absolutely scratch the surface of of what's possible here.

911
02:21:32.970 --> 02:21:44.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but hopefully, just to give you a very very rough idea. But you know it's just that. You can build everything up in layers, and everything is then tweakable and and adjustable.

912
02:21:45.970 --> 02:21:52.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So would it. People rather. I could definitely share a code over lunch

913
02:21:53.190 --> 02:22:11.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Would you rather have? I don't know how I don't know how you guys do breaks normally. Is it normally a long break. Are we having a 2 h pub lunch? He's buying, or are we having sort of a quick 30, 30 min, and come back? What how do we do things.

914
02:22:12.510 --> 02:22:17.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and happy to How about discussion with anybody?

915
02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:23.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I will show you 1 h lunch 1 h. right? Thank you.

916
02:22:23.980 --> 02:22:38.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: All right, then. So we don't all go into the outrages right? Okay, If we do 1230, then all right, so we'll make a start on to the next section. But we're not going to get through it. But that's absolutely fine. Okay.

917
02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:43.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Any questions on plotting before we move on to

918
02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:45.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: our next bit.

919
02:22:53.250 --> 02:23:03.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Nope. Okay. And as I said, this is just one version of one type of it's Tcpot is the main plotting type.

920
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:13.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However, other plots types are available, and I say either the end of today or early part of next lesson, we will look at how to do

921
02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:18.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: some really funky, interactive type plots, etc. So

922
02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:29.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we are now going to move on to the meat and potatoes of our and decent date of wrangling

923
02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:31.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: oops.

924
02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:46.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is so a combination of bits and pieces. I guess so. Sometimes the date is just simply not in the the the format that you want, and you wanna. You wanna. Bring it around in in that way.

925
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:55.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sometimes it's a case of you want to do some sort of calculations and make some new new columns based on the that you've got.

926
02:23:55.990 --> 02:24:10.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sometimes you just want to do some really, really simple, just re-order it, or or or kind of create some functions, or do some calculations across groups, etc. So that's all what we're gonna call data wrangling, and we're going to use something called dB: Dp: player.

927
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:29.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So wrangling, as I said, reshaping or transforming. And i'm sure you've had to get that. I'm sure this is gonna be a complete shock to you. But sometimes Nhs data isn't the cleanest or the most complete, or comes in a consistent format.

928
02:24:29.470 --> 02:24:42.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I know I know I don't know what to say, but occasionally you might meet that so hopefully. This will give some tools around how we can deal with some of that if you ever come across such a thing.

929
02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:55.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So a note on tidy data. So it kind of discuss this or I discuss this earlier that each variable forms a column, and each observation comes forms a row.

930
02:24:55.950 --> 02:25:00.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that's generally how tidy those functions work best.

931
02:25:00.450 --> 02:25:17.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Tomorrow you take tomorrow next session we will have a go at looking at sort of wide tables and converting them into long data, and also looking at some long data and converting it into white data.

932
02:25:18.010 --> 02:25:34.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That will make much more sense if you Haven't used those terms when we actually come to do it. And and what the difference between those is. So we're going to be something called the D. Play our package because we've got our in the library name.

933
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:58.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You will notice, especially when you go on to Cran, and you look at things. There are lots of really really bad are puns and lots of libraries that are in them. And yes, there are some really pretty easy names, anyway. Deeply is really really powerful for wrangling data around. And we're gonna do just 5 of the deeply verbs of which there are many.

934
02:25:59.020 --> 02:25:59.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the

935
02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:05.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: since those those base 5 can solve huge amounts of problems and and

936
02:26:05.730 --> 02:26:10.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: come up with some really funky analysis. Just in 5 verbs on our

937
02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:16.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: next steps, depending on how far we get today. At the on our next section we're

938
02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:22.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: expand on that and show you how we can do some all even clever stuff with these.

939
02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:29.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So our next project is to look at mental health inpatient capacity.

940
02:26:30.180 --> 02:26:43.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've got some data, and it's based on some some real data taking from benchmarking. And we're looking at the changes and the number and occupancy of mental health beds.

941
02:26:43.890 --> 02:26:45.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

942
02:26:45.390 --> 02:26:58.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as we are now making sure a ward is okay fully occupied is a serious challenge. So we've got to make sure that we've got appropriate occupancy within our within awards. I'm. Going to look at all of that.

943
02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:13.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The data is based off of Kh, a free returns which has got bit numbers in occupancy by organization, and it's being published by Nhs. E. And scrape that from Nhs the website.

944
02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:20.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it's being partially cleaned, and we will come to that shortly. So.

945
02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:28.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, to you, whether you want to start a new script, or whether you want to continue on from where you are.

946
02:27:29.150 --> 02:27:35.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: This does recommend you start new script. So let's do that.

947
02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:47.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just so. We have got things. So first of all. let's save our initial one. If you haven't done it Already there is a file, and save, as

948
02:27:47.250 --> 02:27:56.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I thought, i'd already saved mine. or if you have saved it already, it should also should also save as you go along anyway.

949
02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:08.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so that's fine. So mine. If I go into my files here. I have got my training script, and that is last saved at 1,201, which is the last time I actually run anything. So it's all as you go along.

950
02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:17.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But obviously they haven't saved it. I you that. and let's create ourselves a new script.

951
02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:39.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And again, this is something where we can get into some problems with our environments and our scripts. So we've called the tidy verse within our training script. There just created a new script.

952
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:52.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Because I've already loaded in the tidy that's in memory. That's great it will work. I can start writing my script right now, and I can use tidy verse things. So if I start writing Gg.

953
02:28:53.490 --> 02:28:59.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: not there we go. It's gonna all it, and it knows the Gg plot is installed, and it's all good to go.

954
02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:03.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However. if

955
02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:30.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on my next bit of analysis I just load in this script, and don't load in the training script at the moment I haven't got a call to load in the tidy verse. So all those lovely, tidy verse. Things that I've written from here on in will fail because I haven't called him the Tidy Bus. So if you're writing a new script, it's always good practice to. Well, it's a fantastic idea, unless it is dependent on. I have a script to call back in your libraries, even though we've got them

956
02:29:30.850 --> 02:29:32.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in memory at the moment.

957
02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:46.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but we won't do. If we just come back to this after lunch, if we shut down at over lunch and then come back to it. It won't be there within our script. So let's just call it that, and i'm gonna call this

958
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:49.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: training the prior.

959
02:29:52.690 --> 02:30:01.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that would also be not gonna be nicely safe as I go along as well. So I've got a new. and we're all good to go. So now, if I

960
02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:14.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: shut down completely and open up my deep, my training deep, I script. I've got my live library, tidy verse, and it's all good to go. I mean we can leave it back in. It's not gonna do anything because it's already there.

961
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, so that makes sense

962
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:19.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: good. Good.

963
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:29.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So our next bit in is, we want to load in our heads data. Csv: so, hopefully, you can remember.

964
02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:36.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and and also just to note, by the way, that we have still got our capacity a a in our global environment.

965
02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:46.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if I wanted to, even though i'm on this different script, I can. I can do LED capacity. I a.

966
02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:48.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If I wish to.

967
02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:56.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we, it will bring up the head of capacity because it's in my global environment.

968
02:30:56.930 --> 02:31:07.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What's important to know is if I save everything, and you know, go and have lunch, and then come back after lunch. I'll run my tidy that will load in.

969
02:31:07.940 --> 02:31:13.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I will then go into my capacity. Ae, and it won't be there because I would have flushed it

970
02:31:13.850 --> 02:31:19.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: after i've, you know, reset because I haven't told our to keep a of my environment.

971
02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:29.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if I wanted to use capacity a in a new script, i'm gonna have to sort of load it in again. We're not using it as the a in this day as just something to be aware of.

972
02:31:30.090 --> 02:31:37.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Which is why, doing that, saving the environment and then coming back into it, and then doing something on another script

973
02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:57.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: can become really really dangerous, because at the moment I could write a whole bunch of script that does stuff on capacity, i. E. I'll come back, and i'll share this with you, and then you'll go Well, I haven't got class the it doesn't exist anywhere. So anyway, right? We want to use beds data. So we want to go back up to our import data set.

974
02:31:58.950 --> 02:32:01.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we want to use read our again.

975
02:32:03.690 --> 02:32:09.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we want to use Browns. and we want to find

976
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:12.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and open.

977
02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:18.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And again it will come up with a little preview for us.

978
02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:28.680
Rachel: Hi, Simon! Hi! Sorry to to. Could you just do that again a bit slowly, because I I,

979
02:32:28.750 --> 02:32:37.850
Rachel: my computer, crashed up for the last break, and I missed it. So make sure we got tidy vessels, or then we'll go import data set

980
02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:40.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: from. Read our

981
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:48.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then browse. And hopefully you still got uploaded your

982
02:32:50.770 --> 02:32:52.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I can.

983
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:54.040
Rachel: Yeah, that's great. Thank you.

984
02:32:54.890 --> 02:32:56.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

985
02:32:57.710 --> 02:33:01.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we've got a few problems now. There, I hope you can see

986
02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:11.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: first of all, we've got an absolute classic of

987
02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Nhs the

988
02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:19.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: metadata at the start of a file which is really frustrating.

989
02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:30.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say. what I've done is read the top ones, and we've got a total. We've got Kh a referring. Then we've got some blank spaces which is really annoying our actual

990
02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:35.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: beta that we one starts on the third row.

991
02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:42.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but thankfully, we've got some nice little functions where we can a nice little bit that we can change that so we can change it to skip

992
02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:44.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the fast free

993
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:47.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: rose so on the skip here.

994
02:33:48.210 --> 02:33:53.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we just click out of that. and it should refresh.

995
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:57.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And that's given us

996
02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:01.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: proper headers for our data tables

997
02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:12.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that come through with everybody. So now our headings are date. Okay, old name, that's all I have, and

998
02:34:14.410 --> 02:34:22.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no sorry I missed that, because you just do that again the skip it. So if you've got it with the old version, just basically, put a free

999
02:34:22.290 --> 02:34:25.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in your skip and then just click out of it.

1000
02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:29.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it should then just skip the first free rose.

1001
02:34:29.910 --> 02:34:31.250
Rachel: Yeah.

1002
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:32.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yep.

1003
02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:40.860
Lewis Phillips: Is there a way to go back and do that after you got ahead of yourself and decided to just copy and paste the code in.

1004
02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:42.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, for speaking

1005
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:43.570
Lewis Phillips: like I did

1006
02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:52.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: getting excited on a: so yeah, I mean, she just basically go back into it again and start again.

1007
02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:59.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it brows again. So yeah, just cancel out of it, and then just go back in again what we on beds data.

1008
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:01.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I can.

1009
02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:07.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So will that replace what's already? It's right from the Uk. And you just copy over it

1010
02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:09.390
cool.

1011
02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:16.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So just to show you if you just press import now.

1012
02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:31.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just to show you what that would do, it would create a beds object data object. What it won't do is paste. The code in for you. So you don't want to do that. So that's given us our dates there. We've also got another bit of a problem

1013
02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:34.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in the date

1014
02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:39.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is Comfort was a character format rather than a date format.

1015
02:35:39.790 --> 02:35:44.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we want to tell that that's a date.

1016
02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:45.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say

1017
02:35:46.390 --> 02:35:57.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in excel. Excel is like everything today. It treats everything as a date, unless it's told not to treat it as a date which is really really frustrating in some things, but kind of Nice and others.

1018
02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:08.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But our doesn't do that, and we need to tell it. It's a date so we can click on our little arrow next to where it says character.

1019
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:10.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can tell it

1020
02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:18.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what type of data item that we would like it to be. So we like to import that date as a date.

1021
02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:37.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It will then ask us what format it's in, so it defaults to not the American version which we don't want to do so. We want to change the M. And the D around, so that we can tell it that the first one is our D

1022
02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:40.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: day and our second one is our month.

1023
02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:44.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then our y is is long format.

1024
02:36:44.890 --> 02:36:46.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

1025
02:36:46.050 --> 02:36:50.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So make sure you are Dollar signed the dollar.

1026
02:36:51.490 --> 02:36:55.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then why? And then, if you press okay.

1027
02:36:57.890 --> 02:37:00.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that should then do us a new preview.

1028
02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:11.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and convert it into date format, which will put it into, I say, format for us. Does it matter, M. Or M. Yes, it does so. A capital M.

1029
02:37:12.090 --> 02:37:15.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let's just remember what this capital M. Do.

1030
02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:28.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So there are different formats depending on how your month is selected. So if it's got the words, then you can use a. B. Yep. Yep. Year is first. Now, that's correct.

1031
02:37:28.970 --> 02:37:39.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If you've got like a a a column that's got like o one September in words, and then a year you can put that in there.

1032
02:37:39.290 --> 02:37:58.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got a capital. Why? On ours? Because we've got a full year if it was just the part of the year, and it just said 13, and you could use a lower case. Why, to cut that out. So it's various different ways. There's also a really really nice package which I found recently, where you can just feed it. The messiest states

1033
02:37:58.790 --> 02:38:07.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in one, even if they're in the same, you know, when you sort of sent out those here. Please fill in this this this, this excel sheet, and

1034
02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:25.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you Don't set the formatting for dates, and you come back with 50 versions of a date, because the amount of ways you can format date. This is an amazing package which just sucks all of that in, and then it converts it into nice state full map. But anyway, we're not gonna do that. We're just gonna try to change it with our date here.

1035
02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:42.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we should now have Our date will be as a date, and it's gonna put it in a a nice, I say, format for us all. Code is a character, and these are all coming through as doubles, and also just to note it appears we've got some Nas and some missing data

1036
02:38:44.050 --> 02:38:55.010
lauren szarvas: on my on my screen. I can't actually see the data Preview section. It's just completely collapsed. I don't think my importance. Data is big enough.

1037
02:38:57.430 --> 02:39:05.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's I'm just gonna bring mine in. So I've got it again. So what's it done? It's just not coming through with anything.

1038
02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:13.290
lauren szarvas: Yeah, I I I imagine it's there, but just the the the whole box isn't big enough to show the preview it's just got the

1039
02:39:13.540 --> 02:39:16.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the column headers along the top.

1040
02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:25.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I I'll pop this code into the chat. I mean it's the code come from the bottom right out. You can't even see that

1041
02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:36.560
lauren szarvas: I can see the code yet, but I can't. I can't. I haven't managed to format the the dates yet, because

1042
02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:39.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so now what that is, you must have

1043
02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:44.530
somehow clicked and drunk it. If you copy the code, I just put in the chat.

1044
02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:47.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That is the correct session.

1045
02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:53.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, thank you.

1046
02:39:54.290 --> 02:39:55.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry

1047
02:39:55.810 --> 02:40:00.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that we've got some say to might be a screen size thing. Yeah, I don't know.

1048
02:40:00.850 --> 02:40:01.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Good night.

1049
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:10.970
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now we've got another object up here. We've got our view bed status, so it's pulled up through. We could double check

1050
02:40:11.420 --> 02:40:31.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: another really good way of just double checking that your dates is in a date Format is by clicking on it, and seeing which way it sorts it. So wherever it sorts it by date, or whether it's, tries to sort it alphabetically. So you should have year, month, day, which is the default for dates within our.

1051
02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:36.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There are ways of converting it back into English readable dates.

1052
02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:41.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But Germany, if you're using dates. It's best to use that sort of format, because

1053
02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:48.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: obviously it works much much nicer, especially if you try to order things and and to do bits and pieces

1054
02:40:49.410 --> 02:40:55.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: they could. Okay, so we got dates. We brought an organization, name, code, organization, name.

1055
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:57.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and if we click on

1056
02:40:57.510 --> 02:41:08.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: an organization we see we've also got a bit of a time series as well. So for each organization we've got a time series of data. If I click on that one as well.

1057
02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:12.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

1058
02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:24.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there we go. So yeah, we can see we've got a time series of data for a bunch of organizations. We also have some organizations with some missing data

1059
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:32.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorted fabulous. You can get so hopefully everybody's got some data, and just

1060
02:41:33.050 --> 02:41:39.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we could do that summary as well quickly as well, which is always quite nice to have a look at

1061
02:41:43.210 --> 02:41:44.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Summary.

1062
02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:48.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's

1063
02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:53.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: thanks.

1064
02:41:55.300 --> 02:42:12.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And then we go. We have got bunch data. Tell us it's quite nice. It's obviously even on the date. It would tell us the minimum, Max, which is quite nice, just to make sure that you or your data is come encompassing the the period that you wanted to.

1065
02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:27.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got organization codes. We don't see a string, so there's not much it can tell us about that on our beds app, which we've got our men, and we've got our maxes, but it's also told us we've got some n as in there, which is also quite nice to to know that we've got those.

1066
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:41.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And same with the occupants average. So that's that's quite a nice, really simple function to just run on your data when you first get it just to get a bit of a bit of a sense of what that feels like.

1067
02:42:41.260 --> 02:42:51.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There is an amazing package called Data Explorer, which just. I'll show it to you next time we feed it. A new data set, and it will.

1068
02:42:51.200 --> 02:43:01.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It will analyze it for you in the most create. It will do like cross correlations of everything. Give you frequency tables for every single one of your

1069
02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:15.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: variables within there, and do a huge amount of really really clever things on it all from just one command, and it gives you like this 5 page report on your data, which is just amazing.

1070
02:43:15.210 --> 02:43:24.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I would analyze it and tell you where it think, says outliers, what correlates with what etc., which is, which is fab, anyway? That's by the buy.

1071
02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:34.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We are. We are data wrangling. That's what we are doing. Get with the program. Sign it right? So we've got some data in which is a a good start.

1072
02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:41.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've brought in a a less of a friendly Csv.

1073
02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:43.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And, as you can see within our

1074
02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:58.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: read Csv. Let's just make that a little bit tidy. We can see that we've got. We we can add loads of different things on there to coerce our data into a nicer way

1075
02:43:58.930 --> 02:44:05.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in a thing. So you're not getting date as the date. So it's just that we'll check you. You've done that correctly.

1076
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:10.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So input data sets from text. We are

1077
02:44:11.330 --> 02:44:29.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: brows. Was it bad. We want to skip the first free. and it was important to tell it what order that our data is in. So we want to change it to a date.

1078
02:44:29.650 --> 02:44:32.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we want to change that one to the

1079
02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:35.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on that one to an M.

1080
02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:42.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Because we've got date sorry day month, yeah. And okay.

1081
02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:51.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if that's not working to go check the date. Sorry that the code that I put in the chat and see if that differs from what you've got.

1082
02:44:55.230 --> 02:45:03.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Obviously, that's just trying to co us the data at an import stage. There are ways. And again, we

1083
02:45:03.810 --> 02:45:06.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: probably catch that at a later point.

1084
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:16.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Once you've imported your data. You can also then convert it into different types if if you wish, and we can cover that next time.

1085
02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:24.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we probably will do in a, in a few things, because there are some other really, really nice data types that we can play with.

1086
02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:39.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: One of them is called factors, where you can basically convert a string into a factor. So you can make no medium high, and you can all the things by low medium high. Or if you've got a set of

1087
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:57.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: teams that you always want to show in a certain order, so you can make sort of categorical data and and give them a a ranking which is, which is really nice. So you can do that. No medium high agree, disagree and etc. Hopefully, you've got a date now to go. I assume that you have.

1088
02:45:57.850 --> 02:45:59.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1089
02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:14.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's just have a look at our data. So just looking at the head of it. So this is real data. So there are some real issues which we will come with.

1090
02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:26.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I said. We've got dates hopefully, that has come through with the dates. Now, we've got organization cage, which is your link to the organization name. That's just a a one to one check

1091
02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:37.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we've got something. Go to bed, and we've got an occupancy average. So that's just the average number of beds for that month. Average occupancy for that month, and then we've got

1092
02:46:37.650 --> 02:46:47.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: these lovely Nas, which we will have to deal with. So we're gonna have a play with deeply, and we're gonna use 5 main verbs.

1093
02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:52.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which are a range filter group by and summarize.

1094
02:46:52.470 --> 02:47:00.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: They don't sound that amazing. But believe me, you can do magic with these bad boys, and that's what we're gonna do. So

1095
02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:06.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: building with steps. And that's the really really nice thing about how deeply it works is that

1096
02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:36.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: they aren't necessarily used independently of each other, and it's a kind of a step by step process, and then you can make these amazingly beautiful analytical pipelines. We just sort of pipe the data from one to the next to the next. So when I make our mashed potato, we start of our potato, we peel it, we slice it into into chunks, we boil it, and then we mash it, and we end up with our mashed potato, and that's kind of what we will do with our code. So we start with our our object, which is our particular.

1097
02:47:36.270 --> 02:47:46.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: They say we'll add a pill function to it. We do our slice, we do a boil, and then we have an output of mash, but it wasn't my idea. So

1098
02:47:47.290 --> 02:48:04.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in tidy us syntax, we've got our input object, which is our data frame. So our our beds, data, or whatever, and it's all about. Do this to it, then do this to it, then do this to it, then do this to it, then do this to it, and then

1099
02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:05.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: output

1100
02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:21.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which oh, good! This is old school, all right. Ignore that. So basically, we start of our data frame, and we have these things called pipe operators. This has changed in the last 6 months

1101
02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:24.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: might even be a year now that

1102
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:30.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it used to be the pipe operator symbol used to be that which was

1103
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:39.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: percentage right hand percentage sign. It's now changed to

1104
02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:47.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that which is your I don't know what the name of that is up and down line

1105
02:48:47.370 --> 02:48:57.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just off the head of I I will be finishing in 2 s. I will finish at 1230. Yeah, that's called your pipe.

1106
02:48:57.310 --> 02:48:59.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And basically you.

1107
02:48:59.850 --> 02:49:22.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's just shift, and it's on your left hand side above your sort of the the left hand backslash and then create a van. So it's a a 2 part, but that is absolutely synonymous with with that they both mean exactly the same thing, and working exactly in the same way. If you go into stack, overflow or older code, you will definitely see these

1108
02:49:22.750 --> 02:49:29.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: more modern cage will have these. I'll just double check where we are, for

1109
02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:39.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we've done that sorry.

1110
02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:51.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. So rather than getting on to the actual question. look at that absolutely spot on for lunch. So i'm. So we have an hour. So we come back at 1 30

1111
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:59.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: any questions before we break up because everybody got the data in? Is it looking in the right place, etc., etc.

1112
02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:11.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Is there a hot key for the new pipe? Yes, that is. I think it's the same as the old one

1113
02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:16.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: trying to remember what it is.

1114
02:50:17.010 --> 02:50:21.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I don't know what it is because I don't use it off my head. There we go control m

1115
02:50:21.950 --> 02:50:23.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: control, shift in.

1116
02:50:25.830 --> 02:50:31.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but I find that control shift. M is free Button presses, whereas shift

1117
02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:35.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hi, right, All right. It's also free button presses.

1118
02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:41.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So is that actually faster? I don't know to control M. Did you say

1119
02:50:48.290 --> 02:51:00.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that it's control shifting, and when I've got it set up Yes, you press them all at once so faster. No, what, My fat fingers we can argue about that at another point

1120
02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:09.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at the moment I've got mine default it to set to the old version. There is an option in global options

1121
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:19.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: somewhere to change it to the new pipe. Which is, where is it? It's a code

1122
02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:25.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to do to do. Oh, yeah, use native pipe operator. There we go.

1123
02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:30.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I click on that one and Ak.

1124
02:51:33.820 --> 02:51:37.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: my control shift. M is now using the new pipe operator.

1125
02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:42.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So control shift. M:

1126
02:51:45.090 --> 02:51:45.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No.

1127
02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:51.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm: Sorry. Yep. Options tools.

1128
02:51:52.570 --> 02:51:54.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: global options.

1129
02:51:58.690 --> 02:52:07.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: code. And there's an option here news native pipe operator, that one there. I need to that one.

1130
02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:17.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it's it's

1131
02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:22.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: label options.

1132
02:52:29.620 --> 02:52:33.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And then code. and then use that if quite options

1133
02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:42.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you have questions.

1134
02:52:50.480 --> 02:53:00.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: In that case I will stop sharing and see if I can work out how to pause. The video

1135
02:53:01.630 --> 02:53:03.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That one there, I think

1136
02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:07.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: cool. So you at Hopper one.

1137
02:53:25.090 --> 02:53:28.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hey? Okay. So

1138
02:53:29.540 --> 02:53:44.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've just saved my script in the I've I've popped it into the slack, just saying, If you want to download your your code yourself.

1139
02:53:44.330 --> 02:53:56.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you can so normally when you save it. It would just be no normal file folder, and there it is, and it's just a normal folder. Obviously, we're using the cloud at the moment. So this is our virtual folder.

1140
02:53:56.980 --> 02:54:04.340
but you can click on a script that you want, and up here in more there's an option to export.

1141
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:12.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you can just download from there, and it will just download whatever you you've chosen. So in our case it's just our training script that we're doing

1142
02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:26.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so. If you want your ring personal copy when you go finished and you want it download it to your computer. And then hopefully, you can run it on your local instance rather than using the cloud. That would be fine.

1143
02:54:26.410 --> 02:54:49.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: obviously, as far as security and bits and pieces going. Obviously, this is using clouds. All the data that we're using at the moment is all synthetic. It's obviously not patient level or anything like that obviously would not recommend using a opposite cloud for anything that's got patient, identifiable information in it. Obviously use your local and secure systems.

1144
02:54:50.010 --> 02:54:59.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we was. We was deeplyiring, I believe So if I can find this back up again.

1145
02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:13.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, using deeply, so we're going to use deeply to remember to share my screen. That's what i'm gonna use deeply to. Where is that again? Share screen? That's the one.

1146
02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:26.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, I will do. Sorry, Nicky, I was literally pointing on my screen when I was doing it. Obviously that

1147
02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:33.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you guys didn't see that. So i'll just go back to. Yeah.

1148
02:55:33.570 --> 02:55:41.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So within my files here, if I want to download one and have a local version, I can click on my script

1149
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:47.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: tick that there there's an option here for more and then export.

1150
02:55:48.090 --> 02:55:51.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then that would just download it into your computer.

1151
02:55:52.650 --> 02:55:56.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let me just get rid of that, and

1152
02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:02.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I had to chat up all nicely. Let's see. Where was that again?

1153
02:56:04.110 --> 02:56:05.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, there we go right.

1154
02:56:08.310 --> 02:56:16.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: How do you change the name of the Y access? Sorry. Just go back to questions, make sure that we have right.

1155
02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:25.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we did have here when we were going to save our plot.

1156
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:28.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but it was not add labels.

1157
02:56:31.770 --> 02:56:35.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can do a plus, and then we can do labels and then

1158
02:56:35.450 --> 02:56:38.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: go back to this. Go back to our nice block.

1159
02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:45.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can change our labels we can add a title, and then we did a y equals to change our

1160
02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:48.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: by into average waiting time

1161
02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:57.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: rather than what it was. And how do you change the range of the Y-axis? I sorry. Yeah, so we can do.

1162
02:56:58.940 --> 02:57:01.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Why, Lim

1163
02:57:03.990 --> 02:57:10.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and say, we just want to arrange between our today Norton 75, so we can just do

1164
02:57:10.370 --> 02:57:13.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just to remember which order it is to have to do it as a

1165
02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:16.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: how do we feed it

1166
02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:21.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: set scale limits. That's the one

1167
02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:26.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to you.

1168
02:57:26.770 --> 02:57:32.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. So we can just do no comma 76.

1169
02:57:44.650 --> 02:57:45.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: My second.

1170
02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:53.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go.

1171
02:57:54.160 --> 02:58:02.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And that's chopped off the range of our our our data. So we now change our limits to not 75.

1172
02:58:02.900 --> 02:58:21.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Obviously it's giving you some warning messages here. That we've removed a bunch of rows from our data set. So we're not plotting the entire set. So it's just giving us a warning that's the case so we could make it bigger if we wanted to, so we could do minus 75 to.

1173
02:58:21.620 --> 02:58:25.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I can't remember what it goes up to. 275

1174
02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:38.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, and you can sort of question down and change the change the range, the Y-axis, if that's what you want to do, and also if we don't change the x-axis, then we could Xlim in there

1175
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:43.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully. Answer your question right to go back to deeply.

1176
02:58:44.770 --> 02:58:50.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And and, as I said, each and every single thing within that plot is up for graphs.

1177
02:58:51.210 --> 02:58:57.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you can change it and tweak it. However, you want. Have the text still slum it, and whatever

1178
02:58:58.230 --> 02:59:12.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right deeply. So we want to know which organization provided the highest number of mental health beds. So if you remember, back to our data, we've got obviously information on the the date.

1179
02:59:12.980 --> 02:59:19.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we've got information on the provider, and we've got a number of the beds. And I,

1180
02:59:19.730 --> 02:59:23.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got our pets data. and

1181
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:36.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this is still the old version. We're gonna use the new new pipe because we cool kids, not the old pipe. I'm sorry about that. I need to make sure we get these slides updated, and then we're going to arrange

1182
02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:44.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Pets average. So basically put it into order. So let's get back to our cage.

1183
02:59:46.500 --> 02:59:49.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we started off a new

1184
02:59:49.950 --> 02:59:55.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: bit of data. Well, I started messing about with pipes, and let's get rid of all of that.

1185
02:59:56.220 --> 02:59:57.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say.

1186
02:59:58.410 --> 03:00:01.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we are going to start with our beds

1187
03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:03.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: data.

1188
03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:05.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Then

1189
03:00:06.960 --> 03:00:08.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that range

1190
03:00:09.980 --> 03:00:14.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on whatever it was, cooled just on a number

1191
03:00:16.410 --> 03:00:18.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: pets of

1192
03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:23.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's oh.

1193
03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:34.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so basically, all that's gonna do is just sort that call it sort update set by that column. So if we run that through

1194
03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:37.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: again, it's just gonna come out in the console here.

1195
03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:47.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we're not creating a new object or anything like that, we we've we've we've discussed that late date, but basically we can see

1196
03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:55.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Well, actually, we can see the lowest, because it's it's ordered it that way. What we want to do is over it the other way. So

1197
03:00:55.820 --> 03:00:56.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let me

1198
03:00:59.060 --> 03:01:01.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just make a

1199
03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:14.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm just going to make it nice and pretty in this there should.

1200
03:01:22.450 --> 03:01:28.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So obviously that's come through in the incorrect way that we want it. So we want to order it the other way.

1201
03:01:31.910 --> 03:01:38.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so simply that's that should have come up with that as it has done.

1202
03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:47.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But what we want to do is arrange it in descending order, so we can add another function, so we can arrange to sending that out.

1203
03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:56.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we put a sending. I'm: Shannon

1204
03:01:57.370 --> 03:01:58.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that

1205
03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:16.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. okay, there is another sneaky way that we can do that rather than descending.

1206
03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:25.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm sure you've done them in in the same. So you've got all your normal operators. You've got your

1207
03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:32.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: equals, and you're greater than less, than or whether but there's also not operator.

1208
03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:41.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what we can do is arrange and put a not in front of our beds average. which will again

1209
03:02:43.330 --> 03:02:45.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: re-order them in

1210
03:02:46.390 --> 03:02:50.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on a that Hasn't worked tool you give me.

1211
03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:53.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I am talking nonsense. We use that later

1212
03:02:53.370 --> 03:02:57.120
in order to get the sending we do need to use the descending.

1213
03:02:58.770 --> 03:03:00.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, sorry.

1214
03:03:01.970 --> 03:03:08.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, we could do it. Not the sending, and it would out. Put that as a sending. Okay, sorry. That's me talking nonsense

1215
03:03:10.510 --> 03:03:12.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: all the time.

1216
03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:14.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1217
03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:22.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so hopefully, everybody's got Nottingham. Health care was the highest beds. Have.

1218
03:03:22.690 --> 03:03:23.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hey? Everyone.

1219
03:03:24.860 --> 03:03:40.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right time, and stop going off piece because it makes sense city right back to here, so just to say, descending, and the a ascending also works for text and numeric variables as well.

1220
03:03:40.250 --> 03:03:59.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if you put something in descending, if we organize, if we did a sending on Aug name, it would put them in reverse alphabetical order. As I was saying before lunch. We can also create factors and have a hierarchy of things, so we could have low, medium, high

1221
03:03:59.260 --> 03:04:15.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: highest type things, and then we could order by a specified category, and we can create our own categories. So yeah, that that that becomes really really powerful, that you can make your own categorical variables, and they can be

1222
03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:22.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so that you will of sites always come out in the order by what stp or

1223
03:04:22.300 --> 03:04:33.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: wherever ics they they're assigned to something like that. So you can do some really nice nice sort of arrangements. So that's kind of answered that question in a really really simple way.

1224
03:04:33.700 --> 03:04:36.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So on our question 2

1225
03:04:36.810 --> 03:04:43.810
which 2 organizations provided the highest number of mental health beds in September, 18.

1226
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:50.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So similar sort of thing we already know how to do our

1227
03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:56.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the highest number of beds. That's fine. But now we only want to know in September, 18,

1228
03:04:56.370 --> 03:05:14.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we want to use our a range as we do before. So that's exactly the same as it was before. But now we want only the observations from September 18. So basically we want to add a filter into our into our pipeline. So you

1229
03:05:14.210 --> 03:05:22.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a filter does what it says on the Tim. It picks observations by a value or a a a a a rationale.

1230
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:39.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So within this, and you guys are Python uses so absolutely no problem same as you would within python. If you're doing a test of equality, then we need needs to do the double equals, whereas a single equals is like

1231
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:57.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is so I always say single single equals is is so you're actually assigning. This is that whereas if you got a double equals, you're saying is equal to, and then that so it's a test of equality. So we want to get our beds data, and our date

1232
03:05:57.930 --> 03:06:02.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is equals to 2,018 and 901.

1233
03:06:02.250 --> 03:06:15.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And that will basically give us a a filter that we can, we can filter through. So we could also do a question mark, as our explanation about equals to do a not equals to

1234
03:06:15.900 --> 03:06:25.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which we could do. We could also do a greater than or less than, and all of those sort of things as well. So, going back to our data.

1235
03:06:25.890 --> 03:06:42.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We want to get our best data. We want to arrange it, and then we want to filter it. Absolutely no reason within this particular pipeline that we're creating, that you couldn't it the other way around. You could filter it and then arrange it so that would be work just as well.

1236
03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:51.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So i'm going to cheat and copy my code. I just let's go back in minute.

1237
03:06:52.260 --> 03:06:58.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just gonna copy the questions that I've got that in. Makes it look pretty when I get it. No.

1238
03:07:11.740 --> 03:07:17.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: same with Vs. K. We have got our little line of of do not cross.

1239
03:07:20.220 --> 03:07:22.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say, we want to get

1240
03:07:23.450 --> 03:07:25.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: all the beds that

1241
03:07:27.430 --> 03:07:33.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: then we want to. and it was

1242
03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:35.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what was it called? Date?

1243
03:07:36.780 --> 03:07:39.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Date is equal to

1244
03:07:42.450 --> 03:07:48.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: 20, 18 that that should be one

1245
03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:52.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: oops.

1246
03:07:56.330 --> 03:08:03.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we should have this London come up. Is that right? If I done 29, that right? Yeah.

1247
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:17.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say so basically that's what we're doing so each time. Let's say, we see this pipe operator, we're doing a them. So we get in the beds data. Then we're arranging it. Then we're filtering it.

1248
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:31.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Any difference between using single and double quotations. No; absolutely fine to be interchangeable as long as you're consistent. So you can do

1249
03:08:31.490 --> 03:08:33.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that if you say wish.

1250
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:38.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that's fine. What you can't do is mix and match.

1251
03:08:39.530 --> 03:08:42.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and to that, because it will for a wobble.

1252
03:08:45.880 --> 03:09:00.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I that's something I should probably explain. So if, for whatever reason and you might have encountered it before you not closed off a bracket, or you've not closed off a quotation, and you run something.

1253
03:09:01.690 --> 03:09:09.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've run this sorry. Let's just run this little here

1254
03:09:12.290 --> 03:09:23.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I haven't finished off my so I've got I haven't got a matching bracket. So here, so this now it's changed into a plus. So it's kind of asking me by and

1255
03:09:23.810 --> 03:09:34.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I what because I haven't finished off my I have my quotations, or my on my brackets, or whatever. What I can do is, if I can notice that I can just put in my closing bracket there.

1256
03:09:34.280 --> 03:09:43.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that would it would then feed that in, and it would. It would run, and then I can know to put that in here. Also, I've got a really nice little syntax thing there telling me I've got an unmatched back in.

1257
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:53.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However, sometimes I don't know what it's asking for there, and it's just kind of stuck, and if I just press return. or anything like that, it will

1258
03:09:53.350 --> 03:10:02.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just go crazy and just carry on so you could either put in gibberish, at which point it will come up with an error message, or you can just press. Escape on that.

1259
03:10:02.540 --> 03:10:10.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will quit out of that waiting for the next thing to to come along. So let's tidy up my my data here

1260
03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:14.640
and put in my sorry in my cake and put in my

1261
03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:24.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: for any crime. Okay, so what you can do is do mix and matches sometimes if you're writing text strings.

1262
03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:36.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So you could write a texturing which includes quotations, which is where you would get really confused, and it's not good idea. But you can make text strings with quotation marks inside them.

1263
03:10:36.850 --> 03:10:50.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But it does get really really messy. I'm sure you guys have had it as well. When you've done print strings within python, if you, if you just happen to want to do a slash n or one of the

1264
03:10:51.620 --> 03:11:02.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: type things. Then there are ways of getting around it. If you want to actually print a slash n rather than using it as a new line.

1265
03:11:02.490 --> 03:11:18.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and there's ways around that. And that's one of the ways you can do Things is put things within. Quotation marks within double quotation marks. It's yeah, but anyway, we're not going to get down the whole way. It gets thing if you start writing lots of really funky texts. Then maybe that's something you need to look at

1266
03:11:18.650 --> 03:11:24.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sticky. Where are we? We we all. So we've done that one.

1267
03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:41.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've had our bets data. We filtered it. We did our test of the quality we got our double equals. I mean, that's one of my favorite and most red error. Messages I must have met is when I do the single equals.

1268
03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:48.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I will come up with the warning.

1269
03:11:48.440 --> 03:12:06.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've detected the names. Input this means that you usually use single equals rather than double equals. Did you mean date double equals? It's like Yes, that's exactly what I meant, because I got it wrong. So that's just a really beautiful example of a an a meaningful error message which

1270
03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:10.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: A. Tells you something wrong, and suggests how to fix it, which is

1271
03:12:10.530 --> 03:12:20.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: great. We should have more systems that do that and of stuff. So we've done our filter. So let's get on to

1272
03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:22.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a trickier question.

1273
03:12:22.530 --> 03:12:30.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So which 5 organizations have the highest percentage, their occupancy in September 2,018.

1274
03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:35.200
Okay, so that's kind of what this All backwards

1275
03:12:35.410 --> 03:12:39.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we got 28. We can do

1276
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:46.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We work. We can work out the highest of something, so we can do our range. That's fine.

1277
03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:48.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However. what we haven't got

1278
03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:56.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is a percentage better frequency, so we can use a range for our highest we can use filter.

1279
03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:06.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However, what we don't have is a percentage that better occupancy. What we've got is the average of what we have got. We've got the average and the

1280
03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:12.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: occupancy, but not as a percentage. So we want to create a a new variable.

1281
03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:15.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, we're gonna create it.

1282
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:35.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what we can do is do something called a mutate, which basically does what it says. It mutates your data frame and adds in a new, a a new variable, and we can create that from existing ones. So we're gonna get our best data.

1283
03:13:36.500 --> 03:13:38.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Then we're going to mutate it.

1284
03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:44.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we're going to create a new, variable called perk, which is our percentage occupancy.

1285
03:13:45.020 --> 03:13:49.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Percentage occupancy is average of

1286
03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:50.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: average.

1287
03:13:51.020 --> 03:13:54.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, divided by our beds.

1288
03:13:54.310 --> 03:13:55.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: average beds.

1289
03:13:56.180 --> 03:14:06.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will create a new column called. So let's do that. Let me just copy the question.

1290
03:14:09.730 --> 03:14:10.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And

1291
03:14:11.520 --> 03:14:15.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so all the other bits should be the same.

1292
03:14:19.320 --> 03:14:20.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1293
03:14:23.690 --> 03:14:25.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we want our Ps.

1294
03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:27.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: They time.

1295
03:14:29.940 --> 03:14:32.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Then we want to mutate

1296
03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:36.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we're gonna create a new.

1297
03:14:37.630 --> 03:14:46.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The new column which is going to be, and that is so. This isn't about equality or whatever this is, and it will be.

1298
03:14:46.630 --> 03:14:48.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh.

1299
03:14:50.820 --> 03:14:54.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I have divided by our

1300
03:14:56.080 --> 03:14:58.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it all right way around looking at remember.

1301
03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:17.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Look at me. and then so just to remind us it's not a test of in quality, and then we want to do the same. Fail to as before, so we can copy that. But now what we want to do is arrange our data

1302
03:15:17.350 --> 03:15:37.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: based on our new perk we've just made. So we've created something called per. And then within our pipeline, we can call it so. This is where it blows, my mind, especially if you're a a a sequel user. That you can create a new variable, and then instantly use it. So none of that

1303
03:15:37.930 --> 03:15:49.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: group, by kind of craziness and sub queries, and all of that kind of stuff. You can create a a variable and then straight away instantly. Use it within your same pipeline.

1304
03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:52.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and i'll show you later how

1305
03:15:52.230 --> 03:16:06.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: crazily bonkers that can get. So so we've got our best data. We want to mutate our new Perk feel through it by date, and then a range it like, I say, sending based on our new.

1306
03:16:08.450 --> 03:16:12.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that's where sort of building pipelines

1307
03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:14.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: gets really, really clever.

1308
03:16:18.990 --> 03:16:28.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And you can start doing some very, very clever things that's given it. Old school ones that's just change those to new school

1309
03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:29.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: oops.

1310
03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:41.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And what's also really nice is that you can just kind of hover over

1311
03:16:42.060 --> 03:16:48.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and run everything bit by bit and see how that builds up. So I can just start with my bed's data.

1312
03:16:49.230 --> 03:17:01.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I can see that. Yeah, I've got this divided by that. It's 0 point 9 7, yeah, yeah it up to lots of. And a's that's not coming through. That's got all the data in there at the moment.

1313
03:17:01.930 --> 03:17:08.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I can just run it before the then our next pipe run that.

1314
03:17:08.770 --> 03:17:19.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: See that's gone through. So I've definitely got my filter now, and it's still doing it. It's it's joining. And now what I want to do is arrange it on my new column here

1315
03:17:19.130 --> 03:17:27.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to bring out the highest of our. So if I run the whole lot. So i'm just going to control. Enter at the end. I can now see

1316
03:17:27.260 --> 03:17:29.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that. My well.

1317
03:17:29.200 --> 03:17:38.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: A. We've got a bit of a weird outlier here. So I don't know why. They've only got 2 and 2. But obviously that's given them a 100%. And

1318
03:17:39.330 --> 03:17:41.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah, we've now ordered our data

1319
03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:44.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: directly on this new

1320
03:17:44.530 --> 03:17:51.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: thing. So yeah, we could do an absolute limit. So there is a

1321
03:17:52.210 --> 03:17:53.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: slice.

1322
03:17:55.970 --> 03:17:59.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the and my right

1323
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:03.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the end slice.

1324
03:18:13.160 --> 03:18:19.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we could do. Head 5. That's the simple way of running that through.

1325
03:18:19.610 --> 03:18:23.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will give us a top 5 that way.

1326
03:18:25.660 --> 03:18:33.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just to remember there's a slice. It's a slice way of doing it as well. I can't remember what it's called.

1327
03:18:36.660 --> 03:18:38.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I slice head.

1328
03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:42.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is a

1329
03:18:44.570 --> 03:18:49.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the apply way of doing things. It should come up with a

1330
03:18:50.690 --> 03:19:02.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We'll come to that later when we start talking about objects around. The difference between assignment operators and equals essentially

1331
03:19:02.780 --> 03:19:08.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: N. Equals 5. There are another useful error message

1332
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:10.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: not give me.

1333
03:19:10.730 --> 03:19:30.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, there we go. So if we are gonna do assignment to a variable yes, you can do equals, and you could do assignment operators. It's quite nice in our that we generally use assignment operators just to keep those 2 things separate, so that we have equals within functions.

1334
03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:41.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And when we're assigning things, the objects we use the assignment operator so generally it is good practice to use. The sign of price would do.

1335
03:19:41.210 --> 03:19:48.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Once we've done a few more of these. I'll show you how we can use objects and explain what I've just talked about to Mike

1336
03:19:48.890 --> 03:19:49.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Cool.

1337
03:19:49.820 --> 03:19:55.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: who probably, or Mitchell. Sorry. Who? Yeah. Put a chest question in the chat.

1338
03:19:55.530 --> 03:20:06.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry that has given us some data there, so we've got our beds data with mutated it. We've created a new function. We filter it, and then we've arranged it

1339
03:20:06.520 --> 03:20:12.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: based on our new function, and then we've just selected the top 5.

1340
03:20:14.060 --> 03:20:16.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry. Our next question

1341
03:20:17.950 --> 03:20:18.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say.

1342
03:20:19.560 --> 03:20:26.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what was the main number of beds across all trusts for each value of date?

1343
03:20:27.060 --> 03:20:31.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So hopefully that makes it so. Basically we're gonna

1344
03:20:32.590 --> 03:20:37.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we want to create a a bit of a grouping and work out

1345
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:45.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: for each date? What was the average number of beds? So we got decent groups.

1346
03:20:47.830 --> 03:20:53.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So i'm just gonna put the question in here, because that's kind of useful. Say.

1347
03:20:56.010 --> 03:21:04.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we're gonna start off kind of the backwards and work out how we can do summary statistics like, I mean, etc. So

1348
03:21:05.340 --> 03:21:19.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: first of all, we want to get our beds data, and then we can use something called summarize, and that basically collapses lots of values into a same single summary value and all table. So

1349
03:21:19.650 --> 03:21:38.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: think of what we've been doing so far and horrible to use an excel analogy. But that's what we're gonna do. So at the moment we've been doing, filtering and sorting and creating new variables. And that's kind of what you would do on your bog standard normal bit of excel. And that's fine.

1350
03:21:38.290 --> 03:21:44.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However, if you then wanted to start grouping things and adding in means and stuff like that. You would

1351
03:21:44.340 --> 03:21:58.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: probably pop it into a pivot table and create a pivot pivot table, which is like your summary data based on your your raw data. So that's what summarized as it's kind of creating that sort of pivot look of things. So

1352
03:21:59.210 --> 03:22:09.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we are going to get our bits data, and we got to do a means bed. So again, we create a new variable, and we're going to use the mean of our beds average.

1353
03:22:09.980 --> 03:22:14.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And hopefully. You can copy that and get that to run.

1354
03:22:15.640 --> 03:22:18.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and when we run it

1355
03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:22.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, no. it's gone wrong.

1356
03:22:23.230 --> 03:22:26.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It hasn't worked. We should get a a nap.

1357
03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:48.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is, which is bad, because what does that mean? Well, that means is we've got messy data. and we've got some n as in our data, and it becomes quite important to understand what to do with our N. As if we are creating an average. Obviously.

1358
03:22:48.120 --> 03:22:56.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if we've got an an a we could over count that in our denominator or not, and that's where it all gets a little bit confusing.

1359
03:22:56.570 --> 03:23:00.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So do we include them. Do we remove them when we do our calculation.

1360
03:23:00.890 --> 03:23:08.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we haven't explicitly told what we want to do, and so we need to. We need to tell it.

1361
03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:13.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm just gonna put the above

1362
03:23:13.580 --> 03:23:18.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: does not, but because we

1363
03:23:18.740 --> 03:23:19.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no

1364
03:23:20.180 --> 03:23:23.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: specified what to do.

1365
03:23:23.650 --> 03:23:26.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We No.

1366
03:23:28.200 --> 03:23:40.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I also has Nan's, which I do believe Python has as well. When you've got not a numbers as well, and we that those can cause issues as well. So

1367
03:23:40.690 --> 03:23:44.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let's just take our main.

1368
03:23:45.810 --> 03:23:50.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we just want to add an extra feature to our main.

1369
03:23:52.130 --> 03:23:54.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So after our beds, I've

1370
03:23:56.010 --> 03:23:57.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we want to.

1371
03:24:00.850 --> 03:24:02.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I don't

1372
03:24:03.260 --> 03:24:05.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: m equals

1373
03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:07.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's great.

1374
03:24:08.820 --> 03:24:14.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So basically we want to remove our. An as from our main calculation.

1375
03:24:17.850 --> 03:24:26.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then, when we run it. we get ourselves an average. the main that average.

1376
03:24:28.090 --> 03:24:32.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But obviously that's across the entire data set.

1377
03:24:32.210 --> 03:24:42.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: not as per the question where we want it to each value of date. So we want an average per month, not just the average across the entire data set.

1378
03:24:43.300 --> 03:24:46.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Everybody got the average to work.

1379
03:24:49.650 --> 03:24:51.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah comes through, and

1380
03:24:51.690 --> 03:25:08.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we want to remove. We can also put a true as a as a T. But again I old school. I like doing long format to to understand that, and exactly the same as a python, if you've got a conditional, so if you've got a true or false.

1381
03:25:08.080 --> 03:25:20.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which I probably should have mentioned when we were looking at the graphs earlier under the hood, it counts tru as ones and false as a 0. So if I want an account. how many truths there are you can just count.

1382
03:25:20.820 --> 03:25:32.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you know you can just do a some of the your, your true forces, and it will give you a number nice and easily, without having to do lots of horrible, if statements and things.

1383
03:25:32.980 --> 03:25:38.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we change that to main and remove No.

1384
03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:48.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that gives us number 300, but obviously summary across the entire date. So what we want to do is for each value of the date.

1385
03:25:49.430 --> 03:25:54.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we know how to summarize that we got the main value. Now, what we got to do is just do that

1386
03:25:54.070 --> 03:26:01.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: grouping of of dates. And I think I've let the cat out the bag that we want to do group by. So

1387
03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:09.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what we want to do is basically our beds data, group it by our date and then do a summary.

1388
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:25.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So group by and on its own doesn't produce anything. It just pulls stuff together in order for the do something for the next part of the pipe. So group by in itself.

1389
03:26:26.220 --> 03:26:34.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, Jamie to everyone, if it were an a, would we? We code it to an a.

1390
03:26:34.540 --> 03:26:49.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yes, I it depends what the data looks like when you feed it in. So we fed it in, and it was definitely numeric data with some N. A. And a is an applicable thing for a numeric data.

1391
03:26:49.870 --> 03:26:57.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If, when we fed the data in. We told it that it was, you know we coerced it to being

1392
03:26:57.630 --> 03:27:11.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: numerical, but it had m slash as in there, and they were like hard coded in there somehow as text. Then they would show up as nams, because it's saying that there's not a number

1393
03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:22.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in this numeric data set, which would be the same things we could do, and a removes nuns. And there's lots of nice

1394
03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:45.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: codes functions that do like an a emits, and removing all your all your data if you've got nulls in there. There's also really nice data which i'm sure you've done. I'm sorry, really. Nice function. So it's shown you probably done with some of your machine learning stuff, so you could impute missing values, and we can do some sort of conditional stuff that we can recode stuff

1395
03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:48.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that if we got an end flash a

1396
03:27:48.170 --> 03:27:58.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can change it to the average, or we could just change it to 0 or change it to an Ma or or whatever. So with the conditional stuff, and for some pieces later

1397
03:27:59.380 --> 03:28:05.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so great by in itself doesn't do very much. But then, obviously, we can summarize

1398
03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:07.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no horrors. So

1399
03:28:08.730 --> 03:28:21.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: now we have done that. My computer has frozen. Oh, we're come back to decimal. Where are we? I

1400
03:28:22.650 --> 03:28:26.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry. Let's go back. Say.

1401
03:28:28.730 --> 03:28:38.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah. let me just copy that. So there's a couple of things here within our data set. It's. Come back and it's given us an answer.

1402
03:28:47.170 --> 03:28:53.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we run free that it's just displaying here within a tibble.

1403
03:28:54.700 --> 03:28:55.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The answer

1404
03:28:56.940 --> 03:29:21.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: me that in a minute the question about the re the desk, all places can you replace by zeros? What if the frequency is? No, what? The beds average is not. Yeah, absolutely. So. Yeah, we can run conditional stuff on it to to fix the data. However, we wish i'll get back to the decimal points when we get on to the to the next stage.

1405
03:29:21.640 --> 03:29:33.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: In fact, that's right. 9 to teach sign in decimal places

1406
03:29:34.970 --> 03:29:36.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: all right every day

1407
03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:44.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if we wanted to. We can also do. Where are we? We're in Greek by this what we were doing. I remember now

1408
03:29:45.010 --> 03:29:48.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: doing that, and then we do it.

1409
03:29:53.610 --> 03:29:58.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Look at me and my old school pipes. Sorry, Great

1410
03:29:59.420 --> 03:30:00.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: bye.

1411
03:30:03.700 --> 03:30:11.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: i'm I can be very slave. alright. and that gives us a

1412
03:30:12.100 --> 03:30:14.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: result. Things.

1413
03:30:25.620 --> 03:30:28.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Thank you. Big Bang proper job, right?

1414
03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:41.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What is really really good practice is if we are doing a group by so in itself, group by doesn't do anything to the actual day at

1415
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:56.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: itself. It doesn't create anything, it doesn't. I think, however, it does do things under the hood, and in that it does group some stuff together. So it's usually best to ungroup your data once you've finished grouping it.

1416
03:30:56.370 --> 03:31:16.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So once you've got the answer that you need to get to just ungroup it. That won't. Stop it from being grouped from your previous answer. It just means, if you then go on to do something else, it's not already great. It's not already grouped like that, so you can potentially set up another group if you want to, and it

1417
03:31:16.700 --> 03:31:26.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: can cause you problems sometimes if you forget to ungroup something and then do something else to it and then go. Why is it come out with these really weird results so

1418
03:31:26.970 --> 03:31:34.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: definitely definitely worth doing that so good practice is just the add in our

1419
03:31:35.600 --> 03:31:40.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and group at the end won't show any difference.

1420
03:31:40.280 --> 03:31:46.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But is that does come in handy. So where are we?

1421
03:31:50.110 --> 03:31:52.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's pretty good.

1422
03:31:55.190 --> 03:31:56.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay.

1423
03:31:56.580 --> 03:32:02.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I think this one's where we get it to you ideally. All other things we can do just to show.

1424
03:32:03.490 --> 03:32:05.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let's go back to here a minute.

1425
03:32:06.160 --> 03:32:18.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So at the moment I've got my main beds equals my thing. I'm not limited to just one thing within my summary, so if I wanted to, I could put a comma after my

1426
03:32:19.140 --> 03:32:22.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it there, and I could do total

1427
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:31.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: equals, and then you can just do an open, close brackets, which will give me a total number. Give me account.

1428
03:32:31.660 --> 03:32:39.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so I by month. So that's how many they were. So that's the average, and that's the toast that the Count.

1429
03:32:39.380 --> 03:32:43.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if I wanted to, we'll see if you can work out how to do it.

1430
03:32:43.970 --> 03:32:46.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You can copy that.

1431
03:32:48.930 --> 03:32:51.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we could do a

1432
03:32:52.590 --> 03:32:56.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: me because I love a meeting I hate, I mean

1433
03:32:59.120 --> 03:33:00.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so.

1434
03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:16.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can do all of that kind of stuff, so that will give us, then means beds, our total and our region as well.

1435
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:21.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So you can do all of those sort of bits. And I say you're not necessarily

1436
03:33:21.980 --> 03:33:31.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: limited to to one thing. So let's give you a horrible question to have a get out.

1437
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:52.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So this is all stuff. We've just done absolutely so. and there will be lots of help along the way to answer this question. So this is the question we want to get to, so which 5 organizations have the highest main percentage bed occupancy.

1438
03:33:53.060 --> 03:33:54.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1439
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:58.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I just could put my question there.

1440
03:34:00.580 --> 03:34:03.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say. break it down

1441
03:34:04.370 --> 03:34:07.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right? So let's break it down.

1442
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:16.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We haven't got percentage bed documents. We've already worked out how to build that in one of the earlier bits. So we want to use that.

1443
03:34:17.220 --> 03:34:24.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We want it by organizations, not by date. So that's how we want to group our data.

1444
03:34:25.220 --> 03:34:31.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We want a main. So we want to summary statistics. So we want to use our summarize.

1445
03:34:31.680 --> 03:34:38.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we want the highest based on what we've just created. Our new mean.

1446
03:34:40.170 --> 03:34:41.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say.

1447
03:34:41.490 --> 03:34:48.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: good tip like I showed you earlier is that you can run your our code at each section

1448
03:34:48.940 --> 03:34:51.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just to make sure that it returns

1449
03:34:51.760 --> 03:34:54.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: each each bit that you. You want

1450
03:34:56.920 --> 03:35:03.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: acute hate to means not outlier, resistant, absolutely, and and it it

1451
03:35:04.290 --> 03:35:14.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a noise made no end. When people start using main links to stay, and especially I. I usually work in the mental health or learning disability. Serena.

1452
03:35:16.260 --> 03:35:22.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, we've got a patient in one of those arenas who's got a length to stay at the moment of 28 years.

1453
03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:33.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, using a mean with that patient on any level is just absolutely bonus. So Median is definitely the the way forward. There.

1454
03:35:38.760 --> 03:35:48.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If you are feeling really really clever, you can also look at the mean function, and it does have a a trim function, so you can trim

1455
03:35:48.790 --> 03:36:00.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sort of the ends in order to get trimmed main, which is really really quite nice as well, which is another way of possibly getting rid of some of those outlines.

1456
03:36:01.540 --> 03:36:05.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: A. And that's just all built into the mean function.

1457
03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:07.810
So this one's over to you guys.

1458
03:36:09.190 --> 03:36:13.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I think there's a helper yeah over to you. Oh, there's a hint.

1459
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:21.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and i'll just sit back and drink coffee.

1460
03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:25.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: do they?

1461
03:36:32.940 --> 03:36:34.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hopefully? Not too loudly.

1462
03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:53.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So the trick on this one.

1463
03:36:53.930 --> 03:37:03.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And what froze most people is that you are feeding in stuff you've just made into the next part of the pipe.

1464
03:37:04.520 --> 03:37:07.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So just that in mind.

1465
03:37:08.270 --> 03:37:20.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and especially if you come from a purely sequel background. That's just impossible, and you can't do that, and that froze lots of people.

1466
03:37:20.530 --> 03:37:29.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But you guys are. I don't know Python. I don't know python people so you'll be absolutely fine.

1467
03:37:36.660 --> 03:37:39.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Anybody got an answer.

1468
03:37:40.130 --> 03:37:42.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and but he not.

1469
03:37:46.020 --> 03:37:48.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I don't know how to play this. My

1470
03:37:51.820 --> 03:37:54.150
Lewis Phillips: mine's tripped up at the range line.

1471
03:37:54.980 --> 03:37:57.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay. What's it saying?

1472
03:37:58.210 --> 03:38:00.640
Lewis Phillips: Object. Per got not found.

1473
03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:03.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but I find it easier. So if I run

1474
03:38:03.860 --> 03:38:08.070
Lewis Phillips: so in your mutate.

1475
03:38:09.310 --> 03:38:10.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What if you call that

1476
03:38:11.350 --> 03:38:13.660
Lewis Phillips: percock perk under school? O,

1477
03:38:13.850 --> 03:38:17.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and in your summarize what you called it?

1478
03:38:24.780 --> 03:38:25.440
Lewis Phillips: Yeah.

1479
03:38:33.270 --> 03:38:36.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So running through it.

1480
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:54.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So this is gets a little bit confusing because we are. We are going to create. We're gonna arrange based on our summary, which is based on our

1481
03:38:54.460 --> 03:38:56.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: mutate.

1482
03:38:58.280 --> 03:39:07.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is a bit of a mean thing to ask you. But hopefully, it shows the first of all, we wanna pretty all

1483
03:39:08.390 --> 03:39:14.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: beds average, which is up there somewhere, isn't it that one there

1484
03:39:15.440 --> 03:39:16.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: of her talk.

1485
03:39:17.500 --> 03:39:22.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's say we can. We can make that

1486
03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:30.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so just checking that

1487
03:39:33.660 --> 03:39:35.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we have got

1488
03:39:37.410 --> 03:39:41.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but a new.

1489
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:45.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We then wants to group it.

1490
03:39:46.210 --> 03:39:52.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I whatever it is, or name or or C doesn't matter.

1491
03:39:53.920 --> 03:39:55.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm just gonna say old name.

1492
03:39:58.060 --> 03:40:08.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but that's just going to group it by old names. Then we want to find the average of our percentage occupancy. So this is where it all gets a little bit

1493
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:10.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: confusing.

1494
03:40:11.320 --> 03:40:13.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we want to.

1495
03:40:14.250 --> 03:40:19.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which will be mean that's

1496
03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:22.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: equals main

1497
03:40:24.670 --> 03:40:27.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: of our PET book.

1498
03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:32.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Jump on a nick from there

1499
03:40:34.200 --> 03:40:37.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then, and I go and

1500
03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:42.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: equals true, and I can't spell.

1501
03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:46.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's actually a doubt, not a comma.

1502
03:40:50.620 --> 03:40:55.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Then. So we look at our data At that point.

1503
03:40:57.490 --> 03:40:59.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've created a summary.

1504
03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:10.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but we haven't got anything called per cock now, because we've created a summary by Aug name, and we've got an average of our mean beds. So now I just want to arrange it by our mean beds.

1505
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:17.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Name that.

1506
03:41:20.740 --> 03:41:21.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then

1507
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:27.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: let's be good. I'm gonna do an ungrate.

1508
03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:31.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then it's slice

1509
03:41:35.300 --> 03:41:39.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and and any cool

1510
03:41:42.980 --> 03:41:44.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: big guy

1511
03:41:50.020 --> 03:41:56.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that makes sense If you got that happy to talk that through again because it's a bit of a mind blow.

1512
03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:04.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: don't want to. Okay for that kind of anybody.

1513
03:42:06.530 --> 03:42:07.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Where is everybody got that.

1514
03:42:09.100 --> 03:42:11.650
Darren Griffiths: Simon? Can I just ask a quick question

1515
03:42:11.720 --> 03:42:12.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what you can.

1516
03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:14.110
Darren Griffiths: So

1517
03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:26.610
Darren Griffiths: i'm a bit confused about when kind of attributes are available. So you know, a a kind of attribute means means beds becomes available in our range function. But are you saying that Perk.

1518
03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.690
Darren Griffiths: to kind of attribute percock at that point

1519
03:42:29.700 --> 03:42:38.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: isn't available

1520
03:42:40.310 --> 03:42:43.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: when we do. That's data.

1521
03:42:43.570 --> 03:42:46.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got our raw data, and if you can imagine

1522
03:42:47.050 --> 03:42:48.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in excel.

1523
03:42:48.270 --> 03:42:54.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: speak, we've added a new column to our base excel table. Yeah. Yeah.

1524
03:42:54.440 --> 03:43:00.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So then, when we've done a group by and summarized it, basically, we, we're now putting it into a pivot table.

1525
03:43:01.080 --> 03:43:16.710
Darren Griffiths: Right? Okay. Fine. Yeah. I'm with you. We can't then use per cause it's in the main data set. We're now working on a pivot table. We're kind of dealing with the the transform data from here on. Yeah, okay, that that that's fine. That that

1526
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:18.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now when we look at it

1527
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:30.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at that summarize area we've now got a summary by organization. Name. I'm: not just so. That's just our pivot table we're dealing with now.

1528
03:43:30.130 --> 03:43:35.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we've only got what's available in our pivot table, and then we've arranged it

1529
03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:44.440
Darren Griffiths: cool, and that's hence the the the statement about when you wanna at the end in the housekeeping is kind of on grouping the data it's kind of restoring it to. Its

1530
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:47.260
Darren Griffiths: not just a kind of thing. Yeah.

1531
03:43:47.810 --> 03:43:48.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I mean.

1532
03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:54.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you can do absolutely crazy bonkers things like

1533
03:43:54.730 --> 03:44:06.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we've we've created here our means beds where we've created literally a a means best. We can do a cheaperish variable

1534
03:44:07.890 --> 03:44:11.350
Simon Wellesley-Miller: within our summary. which will be

1535
03:44:12.380 --> 03:44:13.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: main beds.

1536
03:44:15.270 --> 03:44:17.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Name.

1537
03:44:18.440 --> 03:44:19.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's

1538
03:44:20.800 --> 03:44:29.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: plus 10, right for no reason whatsoever. Okay, so we've instantly. So we've created a summary variable here called mean beds.

1539
03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:42.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've done a comma, and then we can instantly call it straight away into our next bit. So now, if we do this summary. we will have. I'll gibberish that ripple in there as well.

1540
03:44:42.380 --> 03:44:57.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, as soon as you've created this mean bed, that it's instantly available to use, which is just phenomenal. So there's none of that having to create stuff, and you know

1541
03:44:57.060 --> 03:45:08.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: none of that like calling variables and setting them and all of that. You just create them on the flight, as it were, so that now it's so. So I've got my gibberish variable, which is based on my main variable, which I

1542
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:12.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: built in the same summarized command. Does that make sense?

1543
03:45:14.030 --> 03:45:26.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You can do some really, really powerful things. What we need to calculate a total first for each organization before creating the percentage to avoid doing the average percentage. Yeah.

1544
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:37.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I mean, generally, you wouldn't do an average of a percentage that's bad bad form. But for the for just this example. That's what we're doing, just because that's the data that we've got in.

1545
03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:45.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, there's definitely dodgy bits about how we do our how we do our data.

1546
03:45:46.230 --> 03:45:50.630
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it's got a net here from past, Simon

1547
03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:58.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: saying, how do we? How do we do? Just all places at the moment we've got a I mean bed, and we've got a a

1548
03:45:59.240 --> 03:46:03.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a result with free desktop places. So

1549
03:46:04.570 --> 03:46:11.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: basically we pick, we can stick our answer within a round function and and round it.

1550
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:15.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we've got a main beds there.

1551
03:46:16.450 --> 03:46:27.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we can put a route. Put that within a round function. let's round it to 2, just 4 places

1552
03:46:28.740 --> 03:46:38.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: again. This gets when you putting functions within functions, it gets really messy around commas and and brackets. So. But if we run that now.

1553
03:46:38.960 --> 03:46:45.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully, if I remember, I got it right we now down to 2 decimal places, and if I change that to

1554
03:46:48.440 --> 03:46:59.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: back oh, I haven't actually done that up here. But if we do that equals sign one, I'll do that in a minute. That's our next thing. We're going to show.

1555
03:47:01.430 --> 03:47:02.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and

1556
03:47:04.240 --> 03:47:23.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can run that. And now we've got it to wonderful place. Yes, we can. So depends how we want to do things. So can you display it as a percentage, is the the answer. So yes, we can. And there's a couple of ways of doing that, and it depends for what purpose we want to do it

1557
03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:33.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: generally. If we're doing calculations and stuff, it's a 100 times easier for it to be a number, because you can work with that.

1558
03:47:33.170 --> 03:47:52.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If we want to create this as a table which we're gonna output and obviously show to users. We'd wanna put a percentage sign on there, and I can. We would do that when that we do our stuff on the next bit, where we still show you sort of outputs, etc., so you can then format it as a as a percentage.

1559
03:47:52.200 --> 03:48:01.210
So yeah, absolutely. But that's more for outputs. This is where you know us as analysts who deal with numbers rather than you know, rather than percentages.

1560
03:48:01.210 --> 03:48:18.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But there are. There is a package which will allow you to convert it to a percentage within your data and work with it. It's just a little bit harder to work with. And yeah, to be honest, the actual percent shines that much, much more useful when you actually sort of come to outputs.

1561
03:48:19.400 --> 03:48:23.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Can you repeat, repeat the desktop? But yeah.

1562
03:48:23.810 --> 03:48:27.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say. basically

1563
03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:40.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: i'll just run it for a little bit slower. So basically there's a a round function where it takes X of what everyone around, and then tell it how many digits you will know around it to.

1564
03:48:40.770 --> 03:48:45.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, for instance, I went around this to 2 digits.

1565
03:48:45.570 --> 03:48:46.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1566
03:48:47.560 --> 03:48:51.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if I had 12 point blah blah blah.

1567
03:48:51.730 --> 03:49:00.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I put that in my rounds. it's gonna Would you sit down to 1, 2 one. So what I've done is put my main here.

1568
03:49:05.760 --> 03:49:23.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, the deck Bit: Sorry. Yeah, yeah. I will go to that in just a second. Yes. sorry I will do that now, in fact. So as we've been going through, we've been creating these a little summary tables and all. The only place they've existed is here in our console, and they've just

1569
03:49:24.350 --> 03:49:38.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: given us a result, and then they've pushed away out into nowhere else. So they don't exist. They literally it will come through as a result, and then they don't exist anymore. However.

1570
03:49:38.210 --> 03:49:42.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I want to have this as a as a new object.

1571
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:47.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so I can assign my little beds data, sorry

1572
03:49:49.420 --> 03:49:50.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: objects.

1573
03:49:52.080 --> 03:50:00.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: my little bed state of summary. I want that now to be a an object. so I can literally copy all of this. Well, I mean you can.

1574
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:09.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And again, this is where we were talking early about the assignment operator and the equals Oops.

1575
03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:16.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's not right. We want it there. So now i'm going to have yeah

1576
03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:30.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in front here. That's some. And then assign that this query. So, my PET. Some is going to be my best day, and then

1577
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:33.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and now, when I run that

1578
03:50:34.620 --> 03:50:36.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sure, and

1579
03:50:36.360 --> 03:50:40.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it looks as if nothing happens, because nothing's happened here.

1580
03:50:40.660 --> 03:50:47.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However, if we cast our eyes up here now I've got a new object.

1581
03:50:47.150 --> 03:50:51.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it's called bed some, and if I click on that to have a look

1582
03:50:52.440 --> 03:50:54.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as if by magic.

1583
03:50:55.050 --> 03:51:07.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I have got my table now, and that is now its own data frame, which I can then feed into pipes and do whatever I want to. I could do plots on that. That's now my new data frame.

1584
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:20.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What I did I deleted it now is create it a variable. So I've got my. So I wanted to put that in a round, and I round.

1585
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:22.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and

1586
03:51:24.860 --> 03:51:29.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I wanted to, so I I Originally I did it as a point 2,

1587
03:51:30.120 --> 03:51:44.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But what I want to do is I have it so that I can tweak that deck decimal places occasionally, and you know sometimes I want it to be 2. Sometimes I want it to be 5 or whatever. So let me set up a new

1588
03:51:46.230 --> 03:51:51.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: decimal places. Let's just call it something a little bit more reasonable rather than Deck

1589
03:51:52.060 --> 03:51:57.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I'm just going to assign that number one. And if I run that

1590
03:51:58.760 --> 03:52:03.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I now get basically successful places is one.

1591
03:52:03.240 --> 03:52:11.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But I can then take my variable, and then where it says, comma 2, I can put in my decimal places.

1592
03:52:12.020 --> 03:52:14.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and now, when I run this.

1593
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:19.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it will.

1594
03:52:20.420 --> 03:52:27.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it will slice it. Will. It will do that. And when I look at my data it will round it to

1595
03:52:28.250 --> 03:52:30.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: one decimal place on the

1596
03:52:31.010 --> 03:52:33.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: main that we go down to one.

1597
03:52:34.150 --> 03:52:43.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so if I wanted to. I can make that much much more dynamic. So, for instance, I mean it's probably not a good example.

1598
03:52:43.090 --> 03:52:50.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but I could change that to my any calls the number of decimal places as well. So if I change that to free

1599
03:52:50.690 --> 03:52:53.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then run all of that.

1600
03:52:53.490 --> 03:53:09.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So not only now will my data be rounded to free decimal places is also going to bring out. I need to top free results. Is that right? Yeah. So now I've only got the top 3 results. So again, it's really nice that you can feed in

1601
03:53:09.560 --> 03:53:20.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: one. You can kind of create variables within your pipeline, which then feed into later bits in the pipeline. So if you wanted to only bring back like

1602
03:53:20.910 --> 03:53:23.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's really useful if you want to do.

1603
03:53:24.760 --> 03:53:31.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let me think. Say, we've got a a bunch of sites, and we want to see how much they vary from the mean.

1604
03:53:31.910 --> 03:54:00.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Quite often we go. Well, let's just color all the ones that above the mean as green, and all those ones that are below the mean is red, because, you know, those are above average. Those are below average. We all know as analysts. That's a really nonsensical way of of doing things. Maybe we should use standard deviation so only highlight. Those are our standard deviation away from the main to at least give it a little bit of cisco rigor, because you know that middle area is just going to be wibbly, wobbly, and not really mean very much.

1605
03:54:00.490 --> 03:54:04.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No intended so

1606
03:54:04.270 --> 03:54:15.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: oh, that was a very good pun. Sorry, so what we could do is calculate the standard deviation, and and then just slice our data to to to highlight those which are

1607
03:54:15.420 --> 03:54:20.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: who deviate. Okay, so

1608
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:23.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that was that.

1609
03:54:23.810 --> 03:54:35.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah. So signing all these things, the objects. Now we've done our assignment, and we've done a an assignment operator, You can do it in a pythonic way and just do an equals.

1610
03:54:35.370 --> 03:54:36.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However.

1611
03:54:36.890 --> 03:54:40.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's just smack on the wrist bad data.

1612
03:54:40.600 --> 03:54:42.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: unexpected.

1613
03:54:43.520 --> 03:54:45.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: single. And

1614
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:47.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hmm.

1615
03:54:49.220 --> 03:54:51.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'll copy.

1616
03:54:53.210 --> 03:54:55.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Have you done a. Then

1617
03:54:56.880 --> 03:54:58.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let me see.

1618
03:55:00.010 --> 03:55:01.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let me!

1619
03:55:01.270 --> 03:55:07.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: She paste the whole code in. I put my that's got my gibberish stuff in there.

1620
03:55:08.640 --> 03:55:10.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's the

1621
03:55:10.190 --> 03:55:11.310
right

1622
03:55:15.180 --> 03:55:16.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: He calls.

1623
03:55:25.140 --> 03:55:30.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I always get modeled. The means. Let's have a I just copy yours and see if I can get it

1624
03:55:32.700 --> 03:55:37.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sometimes. R. Is a pain now it's putting functions within functions. That's the pain.

1625
03:55:38.420 --> 03:55:41.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, Oops, let's copy the whole lot.

1626
03:55:46.180 --> 03:55:47.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's have a look.

1627
03:55:50.830 --> 03:55:54.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: How is yours different to mine?

1628
03:55:57.010 --> 03:56:02.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's saying, I've got something here unmatched. 8 name brackets.

1629
03:56:07.180 --> 03:56:09.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay.

1630
03:56:16.140 --> 03:56:18.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that one meets that one.

1631
03:56:21.340 --> 03:56:22.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's just

1632
03:56:30.820 --> 03:56:36.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah unmatched bracket. Yeah. it's another.

1633
03:56:37.880 --> 03:56:43.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So is them pesky brackets when it's not them pesky kids. It's them brackets.

1634
03:56:46.930 --> 03:56:51.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, check another bracket in after the 2 again. That's that really nice kind of matching

1635
03:56:52.330 --> 03:56:53.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's all right.

1636
03:56:54.250 --> 03:57:04.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That that's that's quite nothing but our studio doing that nice matching of of brackets to try to work out. How is everything going for going through and to be fair? It did

1637
03:57:04.430 --> 03:57:09.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: actually come up with a a thing here. Tell me we've got an unmatched bracket. Same

1638
03:57:09.330 --> 03:57:12.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: tries to help you as much as possible, which is, which is nice.

1639
03:57:12.990 --> 03:57:18.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that is that

1640
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:25.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we are going to have a break shortly. But first we going to. So in the

1641
03:57:26.850 --> 03:57:32.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah, let's go on to the intermediate stuff and see how far we get through that.

1642
03:57:33.010 --> 03:57:35.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So in the

1643
03:57:36.270 --> 03:57:43.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in the in the day sets the stuff it wasn't in the day. That that was a bit of our script called into train.

1644
03:57:43.650 --> 03:57:46.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is your intermediate training.

1645
03:57:47.230 --> 03:57:50.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we go into files

1646
03:57:50.600 --> 03:57:53.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and upload that

1647
03:57:54.410 --> 03:57:56.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if you can find it.

1648
03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:02.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I will save this script off, and i'll pop it into the

1649
03:58:05.360 --> 03:58:07.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so. You should have something called intertrain.

1650
03:58:12.580 --> 03:58:14.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And okay.

1651
03:58:19.890 --> 03:58:26.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if you upload it, and then we want to open it, which is just open file

1652
03:58:27.070 --> 03:58:28.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: into train.

1653
03:58:31.100 --> 03:58:36.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say. this is a bit of a here some code we've run earlier.

1654
03:58:36.360 --> 03:58:42.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and basically we're going to run through some stuff, and then there was going to be some sort of code along bits as we go along.

1655
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:51.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so hopefully. so you can do upload, find the file, upload it.

1656
03:58:51.370 --> 03:58:53.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: then open.

1657
03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:56.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: file and open.

1658
03:58:57.140 --> 03:59:09.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So just before we go to break it will come up. So basically, when you load in a new script. Our studio will run through it and check it for additional libraries that Aren't installed

1659
03:59:09.570 --> 03:59:28.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so it's having us here. We've got a couple of libraries that Aren't installed. So we haven't used this Nhs our data sets, and there's a couple more libraries down further on that we haven't got so just scan through and say, hey, you haven't got these installed so you can very quick, nicely. Just press the install button, and that will get them installing.

1660
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:35.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Squeeze uses 5 million different things, so that takes quite a while to run through

1661
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:37.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and install

1662
03:59:38.390 --> 03:59:43.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so hopefully, everybody can get those downloading and installing

1663
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:47.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: while we go and break. Everybody got into train.

1664
03:59:48.390 --> 03:59:51.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: upload it and load it in.

1665
03:59:51.500 --> 03:59:55.720
Phil Debenham: I mean, I'm Simon, i'm getting a permission. Denied error.

1666
03:59:57.860 --> 03:59:59.710
Phil Debenham: Yeah. What stage?

1667
04:00:01.020 --> 04:00:03.240
Phil Debenham: Sorry At what stage

1668
04:00:05.000 --> 04:00:11.800
Phil Debenham: when I try to upload so I can choose the file. Yeah, when I try and open it, it's saying, permission denied.

1669
04:00:12.390 --> 04:00:21.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: How are you trying to? So it's uploaded. It's in here, is it? You've got it? You can see it. I can't see it in there. I'm trying to get it into that section.

1670
04:00:22.240 --> 04:00:24.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, say.

1671
04:00:32.580 --> 04:00:36.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: she did trace file. I need it into train.

1672
04:00:37.690 --> 04:00:40.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I can. Yeah.

1673
04:00:47.430 --> 04:00:48.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Is that still going?

1674
04:00:54.840 --> 04:00:59.160
Phil Debenham: Yeah, i'm getting a file upload error. I'll try and download it again.

1675
04:01:00.540 --> 04:01:11.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, Just double check, is it? I mean it's. Where are we? 24.7 kB? It hasn't just come through with 0 or anything weird.

1676
04:01:18.890 --> 04:01:23.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I upload. Choose file

1677
04:01:32.980 --> 04:01:40.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: into train open. You're not clicking on browse. One thing weird like that. Nope.

1678
04:01:42.600 --> 04:01:44.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And then Ak.

1679
04:01:45.470 --> 04:01:49.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I: wow. yeah, let's just overwrite it. That's fine.

1680
04:01:50.760 --> 04:01:53.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it should just load in there

1681
04:01:55.390 --> 04:01:56.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: still. Not

1682
04:01:56.850 --> 04:01:58.400
Phil Debenham: still get the same error.

1683
04:01:58.860 --> 04:02:00.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Anybody else getting that?

1684
04:02:04.560 --> 04:02:17.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No. But if everybody else is okay. Do you want to take a 10 min break, and i'll just if you want to share your screen. Let's have a look and see if I can sort it. So where are we? We are at 40. So if we come back at 10 to free.

1685
04:02:18.680 --> 04:02:21.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: do you want to share your screen? I just see if I can.

1686
04:02:21.530 --> 04:02:23.800
Phil Debenham: Yeah on set. It sounds like

1687
04:02:25.170 --> 04:02:29.950
Phil Debenham: you're able to enable screen

1688
04:02:30.040 --> 04:02:31.000
Phil Debenham: well

1689
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:34.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in principle.

1690
04:02:35.520 --> 04:02:43.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So who sorry? Who am I talking to? I don't. I can't even see that. All right. So I mean I'm, Phil, you know I feel right.

1691
04:02:43.430 --> 04:02:46.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Bill.

1692
04:02:49.300 --> 04:02:52.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I was just saying that they are in alphabetical. Of course they are.

1693
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:56.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: How are they?

1694
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:07.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So i'm just trying to find you on the list

1695
04:03:07.490 --> 04:03:12.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: out there that's sort of enough, but a little, but not

1696
04:03:12.980 --> 04:03:17.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if I make you a co-host and give you all of that power, See if that works

1697
04:03:18.690 --> 04:03:20.040
Phil Debenham: great stuff.

1698
04:03:23.600 --> 04:03:25.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No abusing it though

1699
04:03:26.460 --> 04:03:29.770
Phil Debenham: great responsibility.

1700
04:03:30.440 --> 04:03:32.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Say what's happening here.

1701
04:03:34.160 --> 04:03:43.150
Phil Debenham: Can you see? Can you see my web in space if I go? Oh, I see You've gone up a level somehow.

1702
04:03:43.490 --> 04:03:50.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Can I say double click where it says projects on your so cancel that and double click on project.

1703
04:03:52.150 --> 04:03:55.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, do you need to do it?

1704
04:03:55.320 --> 04:03:59.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What it what I just trying to think yeah on the down a bit

1705
04:03:59.660 --> 04:04:05.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on the actual file oops. Well, no don't do that. Then click back on our training.

1706
04:04:07.940 --> 04:04:17.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You back to where you were. So basically I think you've gone upper level. Oh, I see. Okay. And now it's put you back on the right level, anyway. So now, if you do upload.

1707
04:04:18.080 --> 04:04:19.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: choose file.

1708
04:04:21.460 --> 04:04:37.580
Phil Debenham: So yeah, on the folder structure, somehow, it put you up a level every day. So I think what happened is I clicked browse, and when it comes to cloud rather than cloud projects, I see, yeah, that you

1709
04:04:37.660 --> 04:04:41.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: wouldn't let you upload something onto the highest level.

1710
04:04:41.330 --> 04:04:45.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which kind of makes sense so, and then press the install, button

1711
04:04:46.330 --> 04:04:47.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: up the top and yellow.

1712
04:04:50.180 --> 04:04:56.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There's packages, a squeeze bubble, and are required, but not installed, and then click processes.

1713
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:59.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it should.

1714
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:04.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go. Should stop loading a bunch of stuff in

1715
04:05:04.800 --> 04:05:06.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there we go. Yeah.

1716
04:05:07.150 --> 04:05:09.170
Phil Debenham: right? So I mean, appreciate that

1717
04:05:09.300 --> 04:05:10.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no worries

1718
04:05:11.240 --> 04:05:11.820
Okay.

1719
04:05:14.970 --> 04:05:18.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: share screen again.

1720
04:05:22.150 --> 04:05:24.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Which one are we all on that one?

1721
04:05:25.870 --> 04:05:26.430
Okay.

1722
04:05:32.400 --> 04:05:34.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: right back in 5.

1723
04:08:27.300 --> 04:08:27.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hmm.

1724
04:13:57.020 --> 04:14:00.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Well, there we go. Well, it's time by me.

1725
04:14:00.020 --> 04:14:03.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What? You got? No, that's so, not fair.

1726
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:15.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Do you need to save, as each time as a safe button, Grace that? No, it also saves on of whatever we what's this thing called? It's called

1727
04:14:16.540 --> 04:14:25.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as you do cloud. It also says that the time you run your code, so you don't have to. You can turn it off of, or a save it. Auto

1728
04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:36.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: also also saves quite nicely within our studio as well. So you don't have to save. But if I start writing code and not run it.

1729
04:14:37.370 --> 04:14:46.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's when the Save button is not not grayed out. So as soon as you've written some since you run some cage.

1730
04:14:46.330 --> 04:14:47.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it will.

1731
04:14:47.810 --> 04:14:50.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It will run hopefully. That makes sense

1732
04:14:51.180 --> 04:15:01.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Good! Good. I hope it will be back and not out Sorry playing snowmen. which I would be had it been snowing here? It's really not going here.

1733
04:15:01.960 --> 04:15:09.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So first of all, just going back. I don't think there was any other catch up from last time that we're all good.

1734
04:15:10.050 --> 04:15:19.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we are starting on new script. So this is a bit of a blue Peter. Here's what I've prepared earlier. So this is gonna go through

1735
04:15:19.900 --> 04:15:35.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a bunch of stuff. We are going to finish here about back quarter to 2. I'm. Just then at that point, going to show you some of the sort of quarto outputs that we're going to look at in our next session.

1736
04:15:35.080 --> 04:15:48.870
So we're just gonna do it a little bit more advanced that wrangling and some some bits and pieces, just to sort of show you some of the extra bits that we can do. I'll then do a show off around the interactive quarter. I've just put it in the slack

1737
04:15:48.980 --> 04:16:02.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: channel, the output from that. So if you want to play along at the end and have a play with all the different interactive widgets, cause that great fun. You can chuck those in there.

1738
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:16.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But hopefully, next session we can go through that and a little bit more detail, and about how you can build similar reports. The the quarter example in there is still a bit rough and ready, because I only just recently built it.

1739
04:16:16.600 --> 04:16:27.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But just to say, you don't have to share it with all the actual our code in there, you can make it just as Standalone reports, without all the arcade

1740
04:16:27.020 --> 04:16:43.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in there, which I probably should show that version, because it will look much neat, and you have it as a completely finalized result. Anyway, that's all. By the by, before we get to all those funky widgets and stuff, we're gonna do some more wrangling because who doesn't love to wrangle.

1741
04:16:43.280 --> 04:17:06.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So likewise we're going to use the tidy again. So we're going to Co. Load that in. We're also using something called Nhs our data sets which pretty much hopefully does what it says on the Tim. It is a collection of to dominize. And so just synthetic data sets, but based on Nhs our data, which is really really cool.

1742
04:17:06.940 --> 04:17:19.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so that if you want to create, you know, if you, if you want some data that you want to, or a process you want to share with somebody. You can point it at these. If there is one of these data sets which is good enough for close enough to what you want.

1743
04:17:19.850 --> 04:17:28.060
Then you can use these data sets. It just means you don't have to share any actual real patient data, because you know we don't do that.

1744
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:37.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I am going to at the moment. Still, I've got everything here within my environment, because i'm working from one thing to the next. However.

1745
04:17:38.080 --> 04:17:45.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I want to flush that and start again. I'm just checking.

1746
04:17:45.580 --> 04:17:52.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, Darren, going back to what is the difference between equals and assigned by essentially nothing

1747
04:17:52.720 --> 04:17:59.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a set. You could only do a sign by to assign stuff to an object you could do an equals to that

1748
04:17:59.410 --> 04:18:18.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just in our we keep them a separate, so that we have an assignment is when we are assigning to to an object. So an object is what we call a over a data frame a value later on, and or I can show you very, very briefly. Now, if we still got some of our initial stretch.

1749
04:18:18.470 --> 04:18:23.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can assign a plot to an object.

1750
04:18:23.400 --> 04:18:25.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if I run that.

1751
04:18:26.190 --> 04:18:32.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and now have an object called pay. and if I call pay whoops.

1752
04:18:35.400 --> 04:18:36.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it will

1753
04:18:37.850 --> 04:18:42.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully today at some point, call up my plot.

1754
04:18:42.370 --> 04:18:57.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we're signing something to an an object, we use the assignment operator, that's just generally, and we could use equals, but it just becomes really really messy when you're trying to read code later on. So it's just

1755
04:18:57.210 --> 04:19:02.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: generally good practice. There we go, right. Where are we so

1756
04:19:02.220 --> 04:19:05.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: got something got into train hopefully that's loaded up.

1757
04:19:05.360 --> 04:19:16.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There was a yellow banner that would have flushed up at the top and asked you whether you want to install all the stuff. Hopefully you clicked. Yes, and that will sort of chug through, because that takes a couple of minutes.

1758
04:19:16.560 --> 04:19:35.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've still got all my messy old data here in my environment, and we're not going to be using it for any of the stuff. We're going to go going forward. So i'm gonna flush this. So there's a little broom here which says, hover over clear objects from the workspace. So i'm gonna press that it would say, are you sure? Yeah.

1759
04:19:36.190 --> 04:19:38.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And that will get rid of all my

1760
04:19:39.100 --> 04:19:43.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: data from the environment. Just so that I know i'm working fresh. I'm not getting

1761
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:52.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: mixed up with with anything else if I want to. I could also get rid of all my plots. And same again, I can do a brush there, and that cleans that up.

1762
04:19:53.820 --> 04:19:58.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And also likewise, if I want to, I can clear my history here

1763
04:19:59.150 --> 04:20:14.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and clean that up, just going through some of the other dots. Sorry some of the other bits within our our data here. Obviously, we have our environment here, which is obviously it contained all our data items. We've got a history

1764
04:20:14.880 --> 04:20:33.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which literally shows you everything that you've run. Just a little command within the console. It shows you the command, and obviously the outputs, and what stubborns is is going on here. But within the within the history there is absolutely literally all the stuff that you've run. Just command by command

1765
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:38.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: connections. If you've got it connected up to

1766
04:20:38.500 --> 04:20:54.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: a a data warehouse, this will show you the the day a warehouse very much like if you've got this a touch to sequel management. It will show you all the tables, and you drill down into those tables before you decide to to upload them in.

1767
04:20:54.090 --> 04:21:01.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And there's also something called tutorial which is really really cool. You can install a package called Learn are.

1768
04:21:01.540 --> 04:21:13.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will basically run for you through a bunch of tutorials around various different bits, and it will so tell you what to do. And then you sort of run code, etc. So that's kind of what happens up here

1769
04:21:13.300 --> 04:21:31.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Files? We've had a look. Obviously, that's just shows you what's in your folder. Obviously work on the clouds. This is our cloud folder. But if we were on the computer that would show us our our computer plots shows us our plots. Oh, I just cleaned mine, so I haven't got any in there. But obviously, if we did, they would be in there.

1770
04:21:31.220 --> 04:21:40.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Packages Shows you what packages you have got installed, what version, and what ones are currently running.

1771
04:21:40.580 --> 04:21:51.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you can you also use that to update and change those help? We did a quick look into that sort of help. There, there's also sort of search functions that you can do, searches.

1772
04:21:51.660 --> 04:21:56.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: viewers we will come through to when we do later. So sometimes

1773
04:21:56.900 --> 04:22:18.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's not necessary. Plot, object you might create. You might create a table, or you might create some other sort of interactive with you, T thing, and that will show within the viewer and presentation. I'm not entirely sure. What presentation does I will have to find out, because that's very deeply new down here. We've got the console.

1774
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:27.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There is a terminal if you want to use sort of more, Linux command line these stuff to talk to the terminal. But we're not gonna do that, because that's all

1775
04:22:27.380 --> 04:22:45.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: linuxy stuff. And then there's something called background jobs which will come in later. So when we do installations that usually flip to, so the background jobs and gets those all going, and when we run some quarter later as well, that will also run as background jobs. So

1776
04:22:45.760 --> 04:22:52.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we're going to do final push. Now it's 30'clock. We're going to go until about 4,

1777
04:22:52.470 --> 04:23:03.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but we will stop as far as you're concerned, about quarter to where we will just do any sort of final wrap ups of where we got to so far. And also i'll just do some show offs about

1778
04:23:03.420 --> 04:23:14.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hopefully a bit of a teaser for some of the prettier and more interesting stuff we're gonna do at the end of next when we get on to the next session. So we're gonna chug our way through this. So

1779
04:23:14.130 --> 04:23:22.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: first of all, we want to load in our libraries, and we're going to basically run through this as a as a bit of a chug frame. So that's

1780
04:23:22.140 --> 04:23:36.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it's also loaded in something called Nhs data sets. So within Nhs data sets there is a data set called Ae attendances. So we want to call that in, and we want to to assign it to something called data.

1781
04:23:37.700 --> 04:23:46.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now, when we've called that we should have data which is 12,000 observations of 6 variables.

1782
04:23:46.530 --> 04:23:51.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can click on that and have a very quick look at what that looks like.

1783
04:23:51.600 --> 04:23:55.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Always good to have a quick look just with your eyeballs.

1784
04:23:55.680 --> 04:24:15.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what we have is a time series where it's based on a time period. We've got an organization code. We've got type one to another. So I see that's where that's type. One type, two's, all type other attendances, and then we've got numbers of attendances, numbers of breaches and numbers of emissions.

1785
04:24:15.290 --> 04:24:26.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So hopefully a really quite simple. They set to to look at and understand hopefully. There's nothing too confusing in that lot. But we're going to do a fair

1786
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:41.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: fair amount of stuff with it. So that was looking at it. Some of them are. We can do some really super simple things. If we want to know the names of the columns which I often use.

1787
04:24:41.190 --> 04:24:45.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can just do call names data, and it'll get this. The names of the columns.

1788
04:24:45.530 --> 04:25:04.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I find that really useful then, because then I can copy that, and then feed that into another function, cause either just to remember what that called, or or whatever, or just double check what you pull through into your data, and it's just a really nice way to bring up your column names in order to use them elsewhere.

1789
04:25:04.610 --> 04:25:18.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can also look at things like if we want to find the unique data items within a variable. So if we just want to call one column, we can use the data and then dollar sign type.

1790
04:25:18.510 --> 04:25:21.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Do you remember when we opened this up

1791
04:25:21.620 --> 04:25:32.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on the Little Blue Arrow. We have data. And then there's this dollar sign, and then all the different column titles. So we can basically call our data

1792
04:25:32.700 --> 04:25:34.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so type.

1793
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:37.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will show us

1794
04:25:38.500 --> 04:25:46.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that we've got free things within our type with Number one, number 2, and other.

1795
04:25:46.580 --> 04:25:51.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Just while we are looking at this data just to confirm that we've got our

1796
04:25:52.100 --> 04:25:59.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: period, which is already formatted as a date. So we don't have to mess about with with changing that as a date

1797
04:25:59.930 --> 04:26:19.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just to say, we've got a factor type of organization code which we will come to later about what that means. But basically they they are ordered so that they are different, so that when we come to group them together we're not necessarily grouping on the

1798
04:26:19.920 --> 04:26:22.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: string factor. But

1799
04:26:22.430 --> 04:26:37.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: there's a there's a sort of layer of data underneath it, same with the type. So we've got a factor of 1, 2 and other, and automatically the data is ordering it 1, 2, and then other.

1800
04:26:37.440 --> 04:26:43.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it's. Put it in that order. And then we've got some very basic numerics for these.

1801
04:26:44.350 --> 04:26:46.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so

1802
04:26:46.360 --> 04:26:56.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can do some relatively simple things, so we can get the range of a variable which is really really quite useful, especially if you got things for dates. So we just do range date.

1803
04:26:56.470 --> 04:27:10.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will tell us obviously the the range of the date very, very helpful, just for having a quick look. Make sure that we've got all our what our bits. We can just instantly see the structure of our data. So see the data to type. So we can just do

1804
04:27:10.560 --> 04:27:21.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: str data, and that will just basically, tell us what data types we got. So again, there's pretty much produces this exact view here.

1805
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:42.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but it just means we can bring it up here, so sometimes you can do some calculations, and you can somehow coerce your dates to being a number, or sometimes, when you bring in dates they don't necessarily come in as a day, and it will throw you. So it's a really quick, easy way of just

1806
04:27:42.150 --> 04:27:58.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: making sure that you, the structure of your data is is coming through as a data. You, Haven't suddenly turned your numbers into characters, and then trying to order them by alphabetical order and and things like that which i'm sure we've all done in various chips of form

1807
04:27:58.810 --> 04:28:16.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: summary data we've had looked at that before. So again, that just gives us a very quick eyeball of our data, so we can see our range here. We can also see that we've got obviously a bunch of organization codes, and there's a a bunch of others on there

1808
04:28:16.850 --> 04:28:36.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: gives us our frequency of our type, one to some others, so that's all good to know. It gives us some means and regions and maxes also good to know that we haven't got any ma's in this data, so that that's, you know, instantly good to know, and good to double check that that's where we are.

1809
04:28:36.470 --> 04:28:48.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So a few a few bits of of of cleansing and sorting out so very occasionally you get things like spaces and variable names.

1810
04:28:48.270 --> 04:29:09.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: This is an absolutely crazy, common thing, if you're it's importing from excel that people will give it a really nice descriptive column name, but with lots of spaces, and it becomes really really quite hard to work with. So we're going to coerce some spaces into our data frame, and then and then put back again.

1811
04:29:09.880 --> 04:29:27.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So what we want to do is rename our all code into organization Space code. So there's a rename function so very much like we've done before. So we've going to get our data, and then we're going to feed our rename function into a pipe. So we get our data

1812
04:29:27.450 --> 04:29:35.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then going to rename. And in order to put a space in in sequel, you would use square brackets in

1813
04:29:36.050 --> 04:29:54.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in, and we're gonna use back ticks. So we're going to rename, and it's backwards. Just so it's it's backwards in my head. So we give it our new name and we tell it, it's the old name. So we're gonna rename our organization code is gonna be our old code.

1814
04:29:55.300 --> 04:30:10.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we run that doesn't look like anything particularly has exciting has happened. However, now, if we just go back to our call names

1815
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:13.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we could run that

1816
04:30:19.470 --> 04:30:21.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can now see

1817
04:30:21.010 --> 04:30:25.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we have got back to top left of your keyboard

1818
04:30:28.010 --> 04:30:29.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: next to the one.

1819
04:30:32.900 --> 04:30:35.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Well, it is yeah cool.

1820
04:30:37.390 --> 04:30:43.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now, if we want to use that. we can, we need to.

1821
04:30:45.400 --> 04:30:53.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We use the we need to put organization code every time we'll have to go into back to which comes really really annoying.

1822
04:30:55.630 --> 04:31:05.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's now rename some more of our variables into horrible things, so we can put capitals. Capital B. We can have one with our all in

1823
04:31:05.640 --> 04:31:12.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: capitals, and we can also put like leading spaces in front of our data.

1824
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:22.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is also a really nasty thing to do, much like visual studio, code or or spider. You can press the

1825
04:31:22.260 --> 04:31:24.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in the console

1826
04:31:25.110 --> 04:31:29.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to bring back previous bits of code.

1827
04:31:35.000 --> 04:31:46.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And there we go. We can see we've got this horrible, horrible, nasty set of of column names which just means it's really really horrible.

1828
04:31:46.810 --> 04:32:06.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as it says that that's now looking much more like a typical Nhs table. So what we want to do is clean all those names to make them to make them useful, so we could go through and do a rename across all of them.

1829
04:32:06.080 --> 04:32:14.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: or we could call in our janitor. So we have a lovely library called janitor. So let's load that in.

1830
04:32:15.960 --> 04:32:20.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that comes with a lovely function called clean names

1831
04:32:20.580 --> 04:32:34.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which I must admit is one of my, I think, when i'm writing new code it's usually library, tidy verse, second line, library, janitor, and then, later in the day, and then the next thing is clean names. So if we run

1832
04:32:34.480 --> 04:32:36.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: clean names across our data set.

1833
04:32:38.720 --> 04:32:39.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and

1834
04:32:41.000 --> 04:32:46.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: then if we do our call names D. So again

1835
04:32:47.160 --> 04:33:02.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's put it's got rid of all the trading, all the leading spaces. It's changed everything into snake sort of yeah snake case. And and there's just made it all our all our bits nice and pretty.

1836
04:33:02.480 --> 04:33:04.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1837
04:33:08.770 --> 04:33:09.529
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry.

1838
04:33:10.020 --> 04:33:25.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Quick. Have a quick practice yourself. See if you can change breaches into number space breaches, number or number space of space breaches. So just have a quick play with that, and then see if you can convert it back again

1839
04:33:25.669 --> 04:33:31.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to just breaches, and the other thing is, oh, change all

1840
04:33:31.060 --> 04:33:34.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: organization, name, organization.

1841
04:33:35.720 --> 04:33:38.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, so that should be code, not name.

1842
04:33:39.640 --> 04:33:47.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Excuse me, that is incorrect in the Can you change organization code back to all code?

1843
04:33:49.480 --> 04:33:50.119
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

1844
04:33:54.619 --> 04:33:55.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry.

1845
04:33:59.759 --> 04:34:03.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And also said it's kind of backwards.

1846
04:34:17.480 --> 04:34:29.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry I didn't probably explain this very well. So in this example we're getting our main data set, and we're kind of over writing it, which is generally really bad practice.

1847
04:34:29.960 --> 04:34:50.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's good idea to keep your main data when you load it in pure as the driven snow, so that you've always got something to roll back to. And then, if you do any wrangling do on another version until everything's all funky groovy. But keep your main data pure, so that

1848
04:34:50.250 --> 04:35:08.509
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if you need to roll back, you don't have to load in all the data. Again, you can just go back to a version where it's. It's safe. So everything within the environment only exists within our and the environment within our within memory. You're not necessarily

1849
04:35:08.509 --> 04:35:25.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: saving stuff. You're not creating stuff on a disk or or whatever, so it's not necessarily a an issue about space. The any issue about space is potentially your computer memory, if you're using really, really, really big data. But then again.

1850
04:35:25.759 --> 04:35:33.369
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've not had that as a. As a as a problem per say, so shouldn't shouldn't be an issue.

1851
04:35:33.439 --> 04:35:46.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: not with the size of data sets we doing, but what we are doing is assigning our data. our data frame to data. So we're actually getting our data and then overwriting it with data. So

1852
04:35:46.710 --> 04:35:53.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just be aware that that's what we're doing here, so that hopefully makes sense. So we want you to rename

1853
04:35:54.270 --> 04:35:57.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: number of breaches.

1854
04:35:59.189 --> 04:36:03.099
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will be reaches.

1855
04:36:14.020 --> 04:36:17.509
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And then, when we look at our call names.

1856
04:36:23.270 --> 04:36:38.869
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We've got this number of breaches. Putting in spaces and stuff is quite useful when we're creating. Trying to make like human readable tables, is actually at some point, it does become quite useful to rename our columns. But obviously, while we're using our data.

1857
04:36:38.919 --> 04:36:46.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: not so much so let's put it back again. So just no breaches.

1858
04:36:48.750 --> 04:37:01.169
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yes, it should be, whatever it was originally, which is all code, not all name the that's a typo on my part. Say, oh.

1859
04:37:01.529 --> 04:37:04.259
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's code equals.

1860
04:37:04.860 --> 04:37:09.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And again, I like just copying it from down here.

1861
04:37:13.849 --> 04:37:14.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay.

1862
04:37:24.419 --> 04:37:25.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1863
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:34.169
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we should have period or code type attendances, breaches, admissions

1864
04:37:35.320 --> 04:37:37.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as our titles now.

1865
04:37:45.290 --> 04:37:46.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, good!

1866
04:37:47.630 --> 04:37:49.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if not.

1867
04:37:57.480 --> 04:38:04.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if you've got a major problem, you can cheat. You can just run line 7

1868
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:09.099
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and line 43.

1869
04:38:09.360 --> 04:38:13.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I know we'll just clean the original names and make them nice, I think.

1870
04:38:15.680 --> 04:38:21.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So Let's look at a some conditionals.

1871
04:38:22.119 --> 04:38:26.099
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we want to create a new flag

1872
04:38:26.560 --> 04:38:27.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: in our data

1873
04:38:28.259 --> 04:38:32.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: where we've got above 20,000 attendances.

1874
04:38:33.550 --> 04:38:36.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, my goodness, what's happened there? That's weird.

1875
04:38:38.810 --> 04:38:42.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go. We have now so

1876
04:38:42.779 --> 04:38:57.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: very, very simple syntax. So we've got our data, and then we're gonna overwrite our data. I think we stop messing it out of our data in a minute, and we're gonna mutate because we want a new, a a new thing, a a new variable. And then

1877
04:38:57.680 --> 04:39:00.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we're gonna call it above 20,000,

1878
04:39:00.259 --> 04:39:15.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it will be, if else so very, very simple. If else I'm sure you guys have used, if else is that it works in that box handed way. So if our attendances is is greater than equal. 20,000 then. Yes, otherwise no.

1879
04:39:17.080 --> 04:39:20.759
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And then we can run that through, and we can look on our data.

1880
04:39:21.930 --> 04:39:27.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we can see now we should have a yesterday flag based on our attendances.

1881
04:39:28.210 --> 04:39:30.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so that should work free.

1882
04:39:30.180 --> 04:39:45.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What we can also do is a multi-part conditional, which is a bit like a case where exactly like case statement within sequel. So we can do our data, and then we can do an attendance grouping, so we can do

1883
04:39:45.630 --> 04:39:58.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: where our attendances are less than 5,000, change up to give it a total of less than 5,005 to 9, 10 to 9 9 9, 15, etc., etc.,

1884
04:39:59.190 --> 04:40:04.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and notes that in this instance are true

1885
04:40:04.290 --> 04:40:05.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is

1886
04:40:05.290 --> 04:40:16.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: our else statement. So a case statement will basically run through each of the options, and it will trigger not the first one it meets

1887
04:40:17.280 --> 04:40:20.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so technically.

1888
04:40:20.210 --> 04:40:27.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: 1,002, what 12,000 is gonna be less than 1,500, but it would always

1889
04:40:27.490 --> 04:40:37.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so. It will trigger there, I mean. Technically, it's less than 20,000, but it will. It would have already been taken away from the equation, because it will just get

1890
04:40:37.320 --> 04:40:41.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: first bit that it comes to.

1891
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:47.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we run that and then have a quick look at data.

1892
04:40:48.690 --> 04:40:59.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we've now got some an attendance grouping based on our attendances. and we've created something across all of our

1893
04:41:00.840 --> 04:41:01.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay.

1894
04:41:02.830 --> 04:41:05.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's kind of useful.

1895
04:41:08.100 --> 04:41:09.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But

1896
04:41:09.840 --> 04:41:23.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's not always useful to do it in that way. So in this instance we've assumed that if it's not less than 25,000, then it's over 25,000,

1897
04:41:23.250 --> 04:41:26.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which could cause a problem.

1898
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:33.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So, for instance, if I if we change our

1899
04:41:34.420 --> 04:41:36.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: first instance to a Ma.

1900
04:41:37.440 --> 04:41:42.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so i'm changing the original data here, and if we look back on our data. Now.

1901
04:41:44.680 --> 04:41:48.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've put an an a into our attendances here.

1902
04:41:50.490 --> 04:41:53.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if I rerun this

1903
04:41:54.970 --> 04:41:57.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: original piece of code here

1904
04:41:58.160 --> 04:42:00.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that we were using

1905
04:42:04.350 --> 04:42:09.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: due to the logic of the attendances. If it's an na.

1906
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:23.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's just gonna go, is it? An a is an a less than 5,000? No. Is n a less than 10,000. No. Is it less than 25,000 no else? It's over 25,000. So if we look at our data.

1907
04:42:24.240 --> 04:42:43.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've gone an a but it's put it in the over 25,000 grouping, which is obviously not where we want it so it's very dangerous to use the else statement in as a as a capsule, because you're always gonna get some weird edge case, which is gonna it's gonna mess you up.

1908
04:42:43.600 --> 04:42:59.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which we will come to in a minute, so what we can do is be explicit about our groupings, so we can say, is it less than 5,000? Is it less than 10 blah blah blah! Is it over 25,000, then over 25,000?

1909
04:42:59.490 --> 04:43:06.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If it doesn't meet any of those creat criteria, let's change that to error does not compute.

1910
04:43:07.420 --> 04:43:11.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So now, when we run this, and we look at our data

1911
04:43:14.430 --> 04:43:18.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: where we've got our a and a though it's now come through

1912
04:43:19.880 --> 04:43:28.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as an does not compute grouping, which is pretty very helpful, because then we can go through and work out what we want to do with that.

1913
04:43:29.640 --> 04:43:30.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: However.

1914
04:43:31.000 --> 04:43:44.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this statement again does something a little bit weird. For example, this case statement fails if we've got a a result of exactly 25,000,

1915
04:43:44.570 --> 04:43:51.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: because I wasn't very explicit with my greater than it equals. So i'm going to change that to 25,000

1916
04:43:52.080 --> 04:43:58.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so just to show you what that looks like in my attendances here. I've now got 25,000,

1917
04:43:58.590 --> 04:44:01.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and if I rerun my case statement

1918
04:44:04.160 --> 04:44:07.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: well. what we would expect to see.

1919
04:44:09.180 --> 04:44:18.570
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and my attendance grouping it's now put my exact 25,000, as an error does not compute. But again, having that error does not compute

1920
04:44:18.720 --> 04:44:29.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: er kind of a message allows you to sort of go back and go double. Confirm your your logic so over to you guys.

1921
04:44:31.240 --> 04:44:39.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so gonna do a bit of a bit of a case statement. So I want you to add another column, so that will be another mutate, and

1922
04:44:39.600 --> 04:44:44.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if it's a type, one return double the amount, the attendances.

1923
04:44:44.920 --> 04:44:50.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: If it's a type 2 triple the amount of attendances, if it's a type. Other

1924
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:58.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: quadruple, the number of attendances, and if it's an error, return 9,999

1925
04:44:58.620 --> 04:44:59.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: as the result.

1926
04:45:02.200 --> 04:45:05.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So does that make sense?

1927
04:45:09.610 --> 04:45:11.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, I haven't got a hit there

1928
04:45:18.480 --> 04:45:36.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so worth double checking the syntax of how that case statement works, as in case when attendance is 50,000, and then the tilde is more or less. Your then statement, if you think in a in a sequel way. So if attendance is less than 1,000, then this is your result.

1929
04:45:39.340 --> 04:45:43.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So it it does work very much like a case statement in sequel.

1930
04:45:44.110 --> 04:45:46.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that that should identically

1931
04:45:46.400 --> 04:45:55.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's just the syntax is all a little bit backwards instead of end. As and calling it something, you're kind of creating it within your mutate

1932
04:47:45.280 --> 04:47:47.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: does help if you can smell.

1933
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:56.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: How are we doing

1934
04:47:59.010 --> 04:48:00.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: any problems?

1935
04:48:03.100 --> 04:48:06.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So there are potentially a couple of problems you can come out with.

1936
04:48:08.010 --> 04:48:12.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: hey? Why is that given it? Why not given it a name? Have I?

1937
04:48:13.340 --> 04:48:16.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, so city me. Let's come up with some issues

1938
04:48:21.260 --> 04:48:22.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: the

1939
04:48:23.480 --> 04:48:24.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry

1940
04:48:24.680 --> 04:48:32.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: When I did my mutate. I went straight into my case when and didn't give it a a column name. So when I've run it

1941
04:48:33.520 --> 04:48:46.230
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've gone through, and it's just given it a default column name. So that's I an issue so to give it a caller name, what are we calling it? I have no idea.

1942
04:48:47.720 --> 04:48:53.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Attend multi bye. more something like

1943
04:48:55.880 --> 04:48:57.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Now, when I run it.

1944
04:49:01.900 --> 04:49:18.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I should have another column. Yeah, this is the other danger of changing your data on the fly in that I've still got my old column there, and I've created a new one is double equals case. Sensitive?

1945
04:49:18.710 --> 04:49:26.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No? Yes, yes, it is sorry. Yes. So yeah, equality is absolutely case. Sensitive.

1946
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:39.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Nope: so yeah, if you've got your other there, and you've put a capital O, so you of the

1947
04:49:40.940 --> 04:49:42.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and run it.

1948
04:49:44.350 --> 04:49:50.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It will put all your others as 999, I hope. Yeah, there we go.

1949
04:49:51.110 --> 04:49:58.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yes, equality is case sensitive. So everything has to be just so. So

1950
04:49:59.010 --> 04:50:01.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah, no worries

1951
04:50:03.270 --> 04:50:04.780
absolutely.

1952
04:50:06.080 --> 04:50:09.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's good. The other bit of a

1953
04:50:09.230 --> 04:50:18.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: trap full of practical, hopeful, mistakes that you may have made is putting your 999 in speech marks

1954
04:50:22.400 --> 04:50:27.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which I think does something funky. Are we cool?

1955
04:50:30.200 --> 04:50:32.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Is that right? Let's try. To? Remember?

1956
04:50:33.300 --> 04:50:35.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay, that's fine.

1957
04:50:36.650 --> 04:50:38.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What is it here?

1958
04:50:39.240 --> 04:50:43.060
Simon Wellesley-Miller: No, no, it's another one that does something weird.

1959
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:51.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: What was that

1960
04:51:00.850 --> 04:51:02.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that we go?

1961
04:51:03.100 --> 04:51:08.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Can't. Yeah, if you do, is it full speech marks like that.

1962
04:51:13.780 --> 04:51:15.980
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hey, top quiet

1963
04:51:16.250 --> 04:51:20.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I a few per attendances times 2 in.

1964
04:51:22.880 --> 04:51:24.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if you'd done

1965
04:51:25.450 --> 04:51:26.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that.

1966
04:51:31.370 --> 04:51:34.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I put these in right.

1967
04:51:43.010 --> 04:51:46.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Is that where you're getting that error. Yeah, there we go.

1968
04:51:47.050 --> 04:51:49.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So

1969
04:51:50.150 --> 04:52:01.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that is looking at a string that basically is gonna pull out a string rather than attendances. So if we do.

1970
04:52:01.880 --> 04:52:07.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: i'll keep that one as attendances times, for in not in quotes.

1971
04:52:07.630 --> 04:52:16.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And I think we'll still get we still get the issue, or will it? No, it won't like that tool. Let's do that one incorrect. So if we did them all in quotes

1972
04:52:21.200 --> 04:52:22.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it will.

1973
04:52:24.340 --> 04:52:25.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Where are we?

1974
04:52:28.880 --> 04:52:39.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go. It will actually do the equates and right attendances times, too, because it's not pulling that through as a variable. It's treating it as a string.

1975
04:52:39.360 --> 04:52:54.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is why, if you don't put this as in quotes as well, it's saying, Well, I can't add a variable to a number. I don't know what type data type. I'm gonna throw, which is why it's trying to say I can't combine a character and a number.

1976
04:52:54.900 --> 04:53:02.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You can't mix data types within a single a single thing. So that was the one to say.

1977
04:53:03.330 --> 04:53:15.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: This is where it gets a little bit complicated, and you just need to make sure that you've got your data types. In fact. Look, I even put we your trends all off the same day. It's like it may, giving you hints.

1978
04:53:16.220 --> 04:53:20.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's make sure that those are there.

1979
04:53:23.940 --> 04:53:35.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And what we got to remember is where we've got type, one type, 2 and other. As far as our is concerned, type one and type 2 are not numbers.

1980
04:53:36.530 --> 04:53:44.860
Simon Wellesley-Miller: They are kind of strings. I will just put the code into the chat. Or do you want to pay your okay to go as well?

1981
04:53:44.900 --> 04:53:49.790
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And we see we can play Spot the spot, the issue

1982
04:53:51.370 --> 04:53:58.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that is my cage absolutely. There we go proper job. say fabulous.

1983
04:53:58.090 --> 04:54:16.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's that's really cool and hopefully just shows you, you know you could start doing bits and pieces on there so like we did before. Oh, my goodness, me, let's just get my day to tidy, because mine's in a right mess

1984
04:54:19.130 --> 04:54:35.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: like we did before. Once we've created that column, or whatever we can then do other stuff to it if we if we so wished site, which is really really cool. So if we've created this new column where we have our attendances and we've

1985
04:54:35.110 --> 04:54:47.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: done a grouping if we want to, then we could then filter on the that group so we could filter on our attendance group. It equals less than 5,000 rather than having to do attendances filter by

1986
04:54:47.240 --> 04:55:05.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: less than 5,000. That makes sense. Hopefully, that makes sense good good. So I didn't know why we want to double our attendances and triple our attendances, but it's just to show you that you can kind of come out with a result based on something else. I think it was just a a a kind of show that you can

1987
04:55:06.100 --> 04:55:15.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: start mixing up your data and doing doing things with them. So we've done grouping and summarizing before.

1988
04:55:15.700 --> 04:55:33.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is kind of quite cool. But you can also do a group and mutate which is really really good at making sub to tools and currently creating data across our up groups. So probably easier to show you rather than explain. So

1989
04:55:33.310 --> 04:55:46.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: what we're gonna do is we've got our data, and we've got our organization code and our period. So we're going to group it by our organization codes and our period. So for each site

1990
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:48.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and for each month

1991
04:55:48.740 --> 04:55:54.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we are going to calculate the total sum of attendances.

1992
04:55:54.640 --> 04:56:07.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then we are going to divide our attendances by the total number of attendances. So basically. what that will do is group each month and each site

1993
04:56:07.530 --> 04:56:23.450
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and give us a percentage of attendances across the total of attention attendances for that for that grouping. So that's just have a look at what that looks like. And I've started at this point now to create new data frames as I go along.

1994
04:56:23.640 --> 04:56:26.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So if we look at this data frame.

1995
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:38.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I've still got a lot of pretty things in there. So we look at our organization. Code. Yeah.

1996
04:56:49.920 --> 04:56:54.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Well, if we tell me it's an organization.

1997
04:56:55.950 --> 04:56:59.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah. what is going on there?

1998
04:57:00.550 --> 04:57:03.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's not what we want it.

1999
04:57:04.700 --> 04:57:06.430
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hmm. Okay.

2000
04:57:08.220 --> 04:57:11.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I think I've added something in which I shouldn't have done.

2001
04:57:12.720 --> 04:57:16.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Let's just remove where it says period.

2002
04:57:18.640 --> 04:57:19.370
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Thanks.

2003
04:57:23.060 --> 04:57:32.500
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's just remove period, so it just grouping it by each of the organizations. Now, oops not one.

2004
04:57:35.440 --> 04:57:54.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And if we just have a look at our data and we look at it by organization page. So we've got all this data by grouped by the period we've now got. The total number of attendances which is our attendance is all added up for this entire

2005
04:57:54.430 --> 04:58:03.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: group. So just for the this. this organization. and then we've done a

2006
04:58:04.110 --> 04:58:17.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: percentage which is our attendance, is divided by the total number of a sentences. With that group you've ungroups. Now it wasn't that I've That is correct. Let's go back to the

2007
04:58:18.160 --> 04:58:25.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's fine. I need to do an ungroup all right. Maybe it was type. I should have put in that what I wanted to do.

2008
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:32.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry, any rate this a couple of

2009
04:58:38.860 --> 04:58:42.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So let's look at it by organization, cave, and type.

2010
04:58:49.730 --> 04:58:54.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: That's not a good one. It's. But

2011
04:58:54.630 --> 04:59:08.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so basically what it's done is taking the organization code, and it's taken all the others. It's creative. A total across all the attendances for other, for that site, which is this flat number here.

2012
04:59:08.620 --> 04:59:15.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then divided by the attendances by the total to get the percentage attendance for that section.

2013
04:59:16.110 --> 04:59:17.620
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Does that make sense?

2014
04:59:19.050 --> 04:59:31.460
Darren Griffiths: I'm in? Can I just ask another quick question? Sorry about this? Deliver the point? But what would be the implication of not typing the including the final on group

2015
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:37.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: clause in this. Just give us a warning. It won't. Actually do anything.

2016
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:45.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's just good practice. It's done. If we came to do something else with that data. it will it?

2017
04:59:45.640 --> 04:59:53.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So yeah, it's not actually gonna change anything. It's just good practice. So it will won't change the output at all.

2018
04:59:53.280 --> 04:59:54.100
Darren Griffiths: Okay.

2019
04:59:54.340 --> 05:00:02.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we then use that data set for something else where we it's it's kind of grouped in under there, so it can

2020
05:00:03.030 --> 05:00:14.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: cause problems. I mean generally it doesn't, and it's very rare that it does. It's just good practice to make sure that you ungroup. So we still got. I've still got my total attendances and

2021
05:00:14.710 --> 05:00:26.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: sorry. So why is that? That's very strange. Let's change it back to. Is it period? I don't know what the date is called yeah period. So I had it.

2022
05:00:33.480 --> 05:00:35.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that should give me.

2023
05:00:39.130 --> 05:00:41.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Maybe I need to look at a different organization.

2024
05:00:43.720 --> 05:00:49.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Oh, no, i's hang on. Let's just go back to the original one again. I'm not.

2025
05:00:53.130 --> 05:00:57.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: How about filtering it? That's how I did it. So now

2026
05:00:57.580 --> 05:00:59.250
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I've done

2027
05:00:59.620 --> 05:01:16.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: organization code and period. So now what it's done is added up for each month by organization code, the attendances of 1, 2, and other, I think, when I filtered it, it just made it a little bit more confusing. So now I should have. My total

2028
05:01:16.980 --> 05:01:27.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: attendances will be my 25,813, plus that which is 3, 5,

2029
05:01:27.340 --> 05:01:31.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: plus 8 1 3

2030
05:01:31.460 --> 05:01:32.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: oops.

2031
05:01:34.690 --> 05:01:51.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is my 2 8 6 6 3, so it's made a sub. It's made a total per month, and then has divided my attendances by my total per month to give me my percentage. So I can see that my type, 1, 2, and others

2032
05:01:51.160 --> 05:01:56.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that makes up 87% of my attendances for that month.

2033
05:01:56.500 --> 05:02:07.610
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The type 2 is made up 2.8 of the attendances, and the other made up 9.9 of the attendances. That's a better example. I was right. In the first place, I just

2034
05:02:07.850 --> 05:02:23.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah. Does that work? Does that make sense? So good. Sorry. I need to trust myself that I know what I'm doing occasionally. So that makes a pretty long decimal percentage. I look. I had a thing. Can you round it to one disable place?

2035
05:02:23.600 --> 05:02:45.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I think we've done that already. So i'm not gonna make you around that. That was more a case of Can you go away and find a function that does round and a bit of Googling? But we've already covered the round function, and there's a big hidden there about very, very mindful about your comma, because that is quite a tricky 10, my goodness me! We are running short of time

2036
05:02:46.520 --> 05:02:51.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: actually. Now let's just do that as a as a practice, because I'm just worried. We're.

2037
05:02:51.180 --> 05:03:04.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: The next bit is about pivoting wider and longer, which is like converting our data shape which gets really really messy, and we're safe. That for an exciting thing to come back to in our next session, because

2038
05:03:04.510 --> 05:03:19.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that gets quite complicated. So let's just try this, so we've got a total attendances and a Herc attendance. We want to change our Perk attendance to only come back with one decimal place.

2039
05:03:20.460 --> 05:03:23.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So we want to adjust our Perk attend

2040
05:03:24.010 --> 05:03:30.770
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to come back with one decimal place, and yes, it's really horrible about brackets and commerce.

2041
05:03:31.660 --> 05:03:34.470
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Can you use round separately. Yes, you can.

2042
05:03:36.280 --> 05:03:37.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah.

2043
05:03:37.820 --> 05:03:57.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So there's a couple of ways of doing it. You can stick around statement around this, so you do it all in one. or you can do it quite cheaply, and that you can have it as another thing, and have a perk. Attend, and then just round your perk. Attend that you've already created. So you kind of overwrite your perk, attend.

2044
05:03:58.550 --> 05:04:03.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So that's just show based methods

2045
05:04:05.350 --> 05:04:07.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so that all in one method

2046
05:04:08.040 --> 05:04:12.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: would be to add a round statement around

2047
05:04:13.470 --> 05:04:14.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that

2048
05:04:15.620 --> 05:04:18.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which gets ready quite

2049
05:04:18.430 --> 05:04:19.390
Simon Wellesley-Miller: orange.

2050
05:04:20.400 --> 05:04:22.910
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I've put that in. There. Is that all right now?

2051
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:26.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So I would check

2052
05:04:34.680 --> 05:04:36.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no uncle, that wrong.

2053
05:04:42.260 --> 05:04:46.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say even I mess it up. Big Time

2054
05:04:48.310 --> 05:04:51.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: should have read my own name about being mindful of the comma.

2055
05:04:55.930 --> 05:05:04.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: There we go. That's popped it in the right place, all potentially a way of doing it when you don't get messed up by by that.

2056
05:05:07.420 --> 05:05:09.560
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so let's just get rid of my

2057
05:05:10.690 --> 05:05:12.020
Simon Wellesley-Miller: round

2058
05:05:19.320 --> 05:05:22.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: is to instantly every

2059
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:25.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: okay over it. With

2060
05:05:32.170 --> 05:05:43.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: how many? To some places one let me go. and you could just feed it into its own sort of pipe and change it, and do it separately like that which

2061
05:05:43.060 --> 05:05:45.010
let's have a look at that.

2062
05:05:46.500 --> 05:05:51.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It comes up with the same result, I believe hopefully, maybe.

2063
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:55.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and I agree. There we go.

2064
05:05:56.970 --> 05:05:59.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So horses for courses, really.

2065
05:05:59.720 --> 05:06:04.300
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but nice to name that you can do it in various different ways to

2066
05:06:04.460 --> 05:06:05.410
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to do it.

2067
05:06:06.700 --> 05:06:08.550
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Okay.

2068
05:06:08.790 --> 05:06:22.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: i'm not gonna start getting you guys pivoting wider and longer, because that's it's really messy. So just gonna whiz through what we're gonna look at next time. So we're gonna finish off going through this workbook.

2069
05:06:22.340 --> 05:06:37.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: By all means. If you're absolutely desperate, you can go through and have a look at it and be teachers PET for next time, and be super fast and and ready. I think this pivot-wide a longer bit probably does need a bit of explanation, but

2070
05:06:37.530 --> 05:06:52.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: by all means, it's all commented hopefully. It'll make sense as you go along. Feel free if you really really want to. Other than that, we're beginning to look at quarter. So quarter is a fab thing where you basically

2071
05:06:52.180 --> 05:06:56.460
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you reading your data, you do an analysis, and then you can output

2072
05:06:56.660 --> 05:07:14.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this kind of document. What's really really nice about quarter, especially in our studio, is that you can feed in several different types of data, and also different types of wrangling, and you can mix our our and python in there. So you can actually write

2073
05:07:14.630 --> 05:07:23.650
Simon Wellesley-Miller: python chunks of code and get it to output into quarter. So it is really really cool and let you do really, really nice things.

2074
05:07:23.650 --> 05:07:37.850
So quarto is basically just a an output. I don't know you guys have done anything and mark down, you might have done. If you've done some git hubby things I don't know. So mark downs just basically a an output language.

2075
05:07:37.980 --> 05:07:42.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: or it's sort of syntax method for for producing stuff.

2076
05:07:42.220 --> 05:07:57.580
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and i'm not going to go into that massively. Now where we go for it or more later. I'm just going to show you some of the types of reports that we've got. So this this: this has got all the this, this output. So this is a standalone output. I've put it into the hints Sm

2077
05:07:57.580 --> 05:08:04.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hsma Tanni, and that's just a standalone HTML document, and it's completely self-contained

2078
05:08:04.100 --> 05:08:20.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you can load download that and open it, and all the little interactive widgets and stuff that i'm gonna show you will work. It means that I can attach this to an email. I can email it to somebody, and they can open it. So it's not it's. You know it's like sending somebody.

2079
05:08:20.830 --> 05:08:37.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you know just a document that they can use. It's all in HTML 5. So it all vendors to whatever Doc, whatever you've got open so you can open it on a phone. And even then all the interactive widgets and everything will work. It might work in a really tiny way, but they they will work

2080
05:08:37.880 --> 05:08:45.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so i'm not going to go this in great detail. I'm just going to show off. A couple of the widgets are in there, so you can

2081
05:08:45.230 --> 05:09:04.920
Simon Wellesley-Miller: mess about with the code, and you can put different codes in there. You can set up headings and bits and pieces, as you see. As I run through the document, there's a table of contents, and as I was through the document, it automatically shows me where I am in the document. I can also click on the

2082
05:09:05.060 --> 05:09:24.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: on the code, and it will take me back to where I am within the table of contents. You can also sort of make sub headings of content. So here, where I've got Lots of sub headings you can see now is expanded to give me my sub headings within my within my document, which is also really really cool.

2083
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:37.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And so there's loads of options to mess about with these sort of things. Obviously, you can do things like, change all the the fonts and italics and strike crews, put things in lists, and do all that kind of stuff

2084
05:09:37.870 --> 05:09:46.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you can mess about with HTML Ts and change your fonts to comic sands or whatever, and put things in blocks.

2085
05:09:46.970 --> 05:09:53.690
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You can also make these really really nice sort of call out blocks with notes and tips and stuff.

2086
05:09:53.690 --> 05:10:11.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: When you can make some clap interactive collapse of all boxes. So you know, people can click to expand it, or if they not want you to have a look, Say, that's really really good to sort of like put under a chart. If somebody wants to say, you know, if a further information go to you can insert images.

2087
05:10:11.930 --> 05:10:31.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: you can insert animated gifts into your report, so they probably not a a great thing to do. You can change the span of your report. So at the moment. Obviously it's so defaulted to this middle spam. If I want to, I can make something go super wide and go across the screen.

2088
05:10:31.260 --> 05:10:45.190
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And what's really really nice in that this bit. Now where I've got it completely across the screen. My table of contents is retreated and hidden until I go past that section, and then it will magically

2089
05:10:45.620 --> 05:10:56.280
Simon Wellesley-Miller: up here again. Look at that magic. So that's really cool. So that's just like some your basic formatting of your text. So the really nice thing about quarter is that you can write

2090
05:10:56.290 --> 05:10:58.480
Simon Wellesley-Miller: text, and

2091
05:10:58.640 --> 05:11:00.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: it's it's it's both.

2092
05:11:01.150 --> 05:11:19.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So basically this is an output document, and it's not a template, or we will run through it, and we look at how it works. So this is an output document. It's output into HTML, and I say, I can send this to you as a report. So it's very much about output rather than input

2093
05:11:19.840 --> 05:11:27.490
I've included all the our code in it, just so that you can see it, and it's here so you can potentially copy it and paste it in.

2094
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:42.120
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But you can hide all that, and just have it as a standardly report that somebody else can have a look at. And yeah, I'm just gonna to with for it really, really, quickly. And we go through in much, much more detail next time. So

2095
05:11:42.120 --> 05:11:51.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah, that's that's what that is. But I say it's it's very much about sort of your outputs. And and a report that you want to create, and some of the funky things that you can do with that.

2096
05:11:52.020 --> 05:12:03.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Are we doing? Scatter catapults? I'm. Assuming that Scat plots. We'll be doing some other sort of plots and bits and pieces next time, and we'll come back to next time in a minute.

2097
05:12:03.670 --> 05:12:31.490
Simon Wellesley-Miller: so we can do some within our report. We can do obviously, really really basic. Yes, we can do catapults. That literally is a N. On cat cat plot which we can go into if we really really want to. But we can create some, obviously a a bog standard lunch out, and we can bring those out which is, you know, quite, quite boring. We can bring out our really really boring sort of tibbles and and produce those.

2098
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:35.880
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And all right, we're going to do cat plots next week.

2099
05:12:36.000 --> 05:12:53.740
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Well, next time absolutely fine if we want to, we can make our plot next to our charts and have some text alongside. We can also put sort of plots next to each other, and have text underneath that

2100
05:12:53.740 --> 05:12:58.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: refer to our chart, so that's that's again really really nice.

2101
05:12:59.210 --> 05:13:06.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can also add our code into our text. So here I've got some text.

2102
05:13:06.980 --> 05:13:09.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but also

2103
05:13:09.260 --> 05:13:14.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: we can also sort of run it and see that it's actually

2104
05:13:14.980 --> 05:13:34.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: input, some some data itself. So today's day is the thirteenth of February, which is when I wrote this thing and I haven't updated it since so bad me. I shouldn't say to that today's date when I run. This is today's day, and and obviously that's static, as at the point of that I've run it.

2105
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:40.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then I've got something here. I've done a an English statement, and I've done a case when depending on the date of the week.

2106
05:13:40.820 --> 05:14:14.810
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then it will spit out so you can mix and match code into into your text. So here I've got. You can pull data from data frames, such as the highest amount of attendances in our data set was 32,209, and that's pulled from the data set. That's not me typing it in that there was 32,000. I've mixed and matched the code and bring it into the data set into my report, which again makes if you actually sort of writing a report when I said out to people, you can really convert things into English, and

2107
05:14:14.820 --> 05:14:28.070
Simon Wellesley-Miller: people like English reports. That's that's really good, never really. Nice thing that we can do is we can have 2 plots next to each other, and we can have them on 2 different tabs, so we can like

2108
05:14:28.090 --> 05:14:38.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: ping from one to another. and you can set up lots and lots of different tabs with different types of plots. So you can have the plot and the table will all various

2109
05:14:39.140 --> 05:14:51.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: different things like that. So that's all quite nice. We can do various different types of tables, so we can make our tables look a little bit nicer. We can make sort of nice

2110
05:14:51.870 --> 05:15:00.420
Simon Wellesley-Miller: tables with indents and grouping and lines and conditional formatting, and all of that kind of stuff.

2111
05:15:00.500 --> 05:15:09.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But I think where we start getting a little bit nicer is when we start making things that little bit more interactive. So we can do like we can do nice tables, and we can

2112
05:15:09.990 --> 05:15:23.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: put in little bar charts and things within our tables. Knock spot lines because backgrounds evil. But we can put little sort of Mini plots and things in there. But then we start getting into the more of interactive stuff.

2113
05:15:23.260 --> 05:15:31.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So here I've got my data table, and what I can do is I can click on here, and I can filter my data table

2114
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:44.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: here, and it will automatically adjust if I want to filter it to a single organization. I can filter that, for I can also turn my filters off

2115
05:15:44.320 --> 05:15:45.950
Simon Wellesley-Miller: if I say wish

2116
05:15:46.800 --> 05:16:04.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I can change this all to type ones, and I can just copy and so and go through my data if I want to. I could press on attendances and all of my data as I wish. So it's just giving somebody a a data table they can mess with

2117
05:16:04.720 --> 05:16:20.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at the moment. I've got it defaulted to show you 10 entries if I want to. I can expand that to show 25. So now I've got sort of a much bigger data table, and that's just expanded automatically to to fill that in. Let's go back to 10,

2118
05:16:22.420 --> 05:16:50.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and what I can do as well with my filter data. If I want to, I can press copy, and that will copy it on the clickboard. I can press Csv. And that will download a Cs first Csv version of the data as at the point I filtered it to. So at the moment it's gonna filter. If I press Csv, it will save me a copy of type ones for this period, and and and whatever here. So that's really cool. I can also save this table as a Pdf. Or or just like straight to

2119
05:16:50.870 --> 05:16:59.510
Simon Wellesley-Miller: print, which is quite nice. So that's just including a a a. To people for people to look at. And again I can go through, and I can click

2120
05:16:59.640 --> 05:17:18.180
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and see the different bits within that if I want. So that's a a nice way to show your data table. Another type of data table that you can do is sort of a reactive data table where. So this is using the same data set that we've been playing with, and

2121
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:25.110
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at the moment it's sort of aggregated up to the the period, but we can then drill down to work at the

2122
05:17:25.260 --> 05:17:37.000
Simon Wellesley-Miller: median attendances overall in March was this, and then we could break it down by each of the different types, and if we really want to, we could drill another level and see it

2123
05:17:37.100 --> 05:18:01.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: at each of the organizations, and that you can drill that. So it's again. If you've got the kind of quite nice hierarchical data it's like. It's very nice to show that top level, and then be able to drill down into individual teams or whatever. And all this stuff around the medium attendances and the sort of Max breaches and mean emissions again, is all built within the table, so not have to calculate those separately. Those are just sort of

2124
05:18:01.850 --> 05:18:12.080
Simon Wellesley-Miller: built within the table function, which is quite nice. So plots Plotley is quite nice. So here's a whoops.

2125
05:18:12.340 --> 05:18:26.750
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Here's a plot that we have earlier, exactly the same plot. However, this one is now interactive, so we can sort of hover over it, and it will give us the sort of tool tips we can click on

2126
05:18:27.550 --> 05:18:35.140
Simon Wellesley-Miller: traces and turn them on, on and off. If we say wish, if we want to, we can click and drag across an area.

2127
05:18:35.280 --> 05:18:54.890
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and that will zoom in to that area if we so wish. And then, if we wanted to, we could take a screenshot of that zoom, and it would. It would save that. Or we can bring that back in. We can tell it to do multi-line comparison. So now we are still comparing each of these data points across each of those areas.

2128
05:18:54.890 --> 05:19:08.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And let's say we'll show you the the code for that, though, is super super fabulous. So we've already created a a plot, and then we want to convert it to. Sorry. It's very, very strange there

2129
05:19:08.670 --> 05:19:16.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to a Gg. Plot. So it's just literally one type, one line of code, and it will create a a plot.

2130
05:19:18.630 --> 05:19:22.720
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And again we can sort of create box plots of of stuff.

2131
05:19:22.720 --> 05:19:41.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And again, it's really nice if we've got all these different things that we can then do zoom in and have a look at what those individual box pots that like. We've also got some really nice hover over is where we can look at that, and it will tell us that means and our quartiles on a on a box plot just by a hover over, which is, which is really nice

2132
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:48.840
Simon Wellesley-Miller: getting into the just because you can doesn't mean you should area

2133
05:19:49.000 --> 05:19:53.220
Simon Wellesley-Miller: very mindful of time. Oh, no, it's not going to that one yet.

2134
05:19:54.120 --> 05:19:55.710
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can

2135
05:19:56.930 --> 05:20:00.780
Simon Wellesley-Miller: do animated plots I the time

2136
05:20:01.100 --> 05:20:20.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: that's not coming through very smoothly on my screen. I guess that's because I've got 500 things running, but have a go at. You have a go with it on your own, and it should come free, really nice and smooth, and it goes all wibbly wobbly across the screen practice. And you've got this little slider, then, which you can go forwards

2137
05:20:20.130 --> 05:20:23.100
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and back into time, if you say wish.

2138
05:20:23.850 --> 05:20:42.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: which is nice. Another crazy thing you can do if you really really want to, is based on that data that we had. We could map our admissions, breaches, and attendances on a scatter plot and make that a 3D plot which we can then

2139
05:20:42.570 --> 05:20:55.160
Simon Wellesley-Miller: zoom around and spin around on at making me dizzy, just looking at it. And you can sort of zoom in and out and do all manner of crazy things

2140
05:20:55.370 --> 05:21:00.660
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and sort of spin it around some more. Not entirely sure. Why, but, hey, Why not

2141
05:21:00.720 --> 05:21:18.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: say it, please? I'll make 3D graphs and send those out, but you can, and some of those quite useful. Another really good thing, for if you got Time Series is something called Digraphs, which allows you to sort of zoom into a specific area of a a a time series, if you say wished

2142
05:21:18.790 --> 05:21:34.050
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Doesn't really explain it very well here, but I've got a little one, and that's just that. Give me a a rolling window for medium, so I can change that to 3, and that will just sort of smooth the data on the fly to show me what my

2143
05:21:34.380 --> 05:21:37.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Ro new region.

2144
05:21:37.320 --> 05:21:39.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Sorry am I smooth

2145
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:56.940
Simon Wellesley-Miller: data. Looks like not gonna go into that more. Now you can do nice little funky survey plots. So do you like stuff, and you can do these, like strongly agree, Discreet type plots that are really quite easy to to come out with.

2146
05:21:57.390 --> 05:22:09.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can do tree maps, which is like an alternative to up to a price chart, so we can look at our our H one and our R. H. 4, and we can see our proportion of attendances by one to another.

2147
05:22:09.970 --> 05:22:25.320
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But this is also interactive as well. So if we click on our our H one that will expand out, and then we can look at our our H one in much more detail, and then we can sort of go back a level if we so wish, and then click on our H. 4 and see what that looks like

2148
05:22:25.390 --> 05:22:43.900
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and get back. Obviously, this is on a really simple example. You can set it up so you can have hierarchies within hierarchies within hierarchies. So if you want to look at comparisons of types across different things at that becomes really easy, and obviously that's much nicer than trying to do the same on a on a pie chart.

2149
05:22:43.900 --> 05:22:50.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Blah blah blah! If you want to do something like show Oops

2150
05:22:50.380 --> 05:23:07.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: pathways through a system. Really nice way of doing that is to sort of a a dendogram. And again, this is also built on the fly. So we can look at our base data, and then we can expand out. So in our K 9, what proportion went to one to another.

2151
05:23:07.150 --> 05:23:19.590
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then, if we say, wish, we can then sort of work out from those where that's attendances, breaches, or whatever. And you can click, and you can play on those I love playing with these because it's very pretty, so you can kind of

2152
05:23:19.590 --> 05:23:34.040
Simon Wellesley-Miller: really good for sort of mapping pathways. And so showing thing. Yeah, how do I open this in my browser literally just open it in anything that's not Internet explorer. You should probably have to download it from the

2153
05:23:34.630 --> 05:23:40.210
Simon Wellesley-Miller: from this from the slack and then open it, and it will just open.

2154
05:23:40.260 --> 05:24:02.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and you can play with all of these bits. We can do like funky heat maps. So this is showing measles, and this is when they introduce the vaccine, the measles vaccine. So it's. Obviously, each of these is the individual country. This is definitely one where this sort of zoom in comes in handy, so we can sort of zoom into areas

2155
05:24:02.310 --> 05:24:10.800
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and see what impact it had in these areas. So this is numbers of cases as a heat map over time.

2156
05:24:10.830 --> 05:24:16.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then this is where they introduce the vaccine, and we can see instantly that sort of drop off.

2157
05:24:16.850 --> 05:24:29.730
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and we've also got these sort of like side bars of additional charts as well, which again, out of all of hover overable, which is really really nice, we can make plotly

2158
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:43.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: plots where we can. Basically, instead of having them all on one chart, we can. We can source Cop go from one to another and create little drop down so you can choose which site you want to do.

2159
05:24:44.130 --> 05:24:48.820
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can. We can make maps with leaflets

2160
05:24:52.010 --> 05:25:01.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: just a very, very simple one here. Yes, he is basically. Spinning around just because there was an option in the code. And I didn't know what it said it. Where was it?

2161
05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:21.330
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Where is it. Yeah, there was an option for spin, and I was like, what what does that mean? And it says, spin. It's true. So I thought, let's see what that does, and spin, and, as you can see, it makes the little icon spin which is completely useless. But we can. We can zoom in and out on our

2162
05:25:21.440 --> 05:25:29.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: icon are the wide and span the same syntax as in Mark Mark down there. The syntax is slightly different than our mark down.

2163
05:25:29.980 --> 05:25:40.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: but we can sort of click and drag our thing. We can also have different layers on our app, so we can sort of turn them on and off as they wish.

2164
05:25:40.830 --> 05:25:42.410
We need you there.

2165
05:25:42.790 --> 05:25:46.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: We can create word clouds. Say 2

2166
05:25:46.920 --> 05:26:03.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: to get cancel that because there's a lot of stuff in there, so it's a little word cloud there which is based off some some data we feed in. And this is again, it's all also interactive. So you can sort of hold her over and see what your frequencies are for each of your words. So that's quite nice.

2167
05:26:03.930 --> 05:26:17.870
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Hopefully, you can work out what the the original book that I stole that from all the codes in there about, You know. I think you've done some text processing you probably have with down about how to remove, stop words and various different bits and pieces.

2168
05:26:17.900 --> 05:26:33.540
Simon Wellesley-Miller: You can create something called mermaid diagrams. This isn't part of our this is part of Quatro, but allows you to make really, really quite nice. So flow chart some bits and pieces in a really relatively simple way.

2169
05:26:33.540 --> 05:26:44.360
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So you can do very simple. Just want to know the decisions and outputs, or you can make these much, much more sort of complex type stuff in there.

2170
05:26:44.360 --> 05:26:57.170
Simon Wellesley-Miller: or there is something called gruff. These networks as well, which also allows you to make a flash. I've not explored that one so well, because I like mermaid so much. Looks like it does a very similar sort of thing.

2171
05:26:58.070 --> 05:27:13.660
and then I think finally we got our pivot table, which I think is one of my favorite little widgets, where you can give it a data set and give it a a kind of a a really nice sort of pivot table, where you can sort of hand out your data to your

2172
05:27:13.660 --> 05:27:32.930
Simon Wellesley-Miller: your customers, and they can have a little bit of a play of it in a in a pivot tablely way, but hopefully not so not so dangerous, so you can. At the moment. I've got all code and type. If i'm me, I can click and drag that, and it will change that to type. If I wanted to, I could bring in my period.

2173
05:27:32.930 --> 05:27:45.130
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then it would show it in a in a wider format that I can scroll across and have a look, but i'm not going to if I want to. I can then filter this down and remove the type 2 s if I wanted to.

2174
05:27:45.150 --> 05:27:51.670
Simon Wellesley-Miller: rather than account, I could change that to the median of

2175
05:27:52.200 --> 05:28:09.640
Simon Wellesley-Miller: attendances. So one of my big bug bears in excel is that you can't do a meeting in a pivot table, whereas this just does which is nice at the moment. Obviously, we've got it in a table here, but maybe we don't want it in a table. Maybe I want it in a bar chart.

2176
05:28:10.130 --> 05:28:13.030
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and it should. If it's not

2177
05:28:13.300 --> 05:28:14.310
Simon Wellesley-Miller: yeah, we can.

2178
05:28:14.500 --> 05:28:43.150
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It will convert it into a little bar chart for me, and it does all manner of different things. There's there's loads of options. We could do that all heat map, if needs to be, anyway. And all of that is basically on one line of code there which creates this widget which you can and play with. So we will go through some more wrangling. I think we're going to run for you. How to do Spc: charts.

2179
05:28:43.150 --> 05:28:58.520
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I'm gonna run through how this report runs and and works, and there's sort of decade available to to do that, how to do some funky outputs, and probably if you've got any sort of specific bits and pieces that you want us to cover.

2180
05:28:58.630 --> 05:29:07.960
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Ping me in the slack, and I have a look at it next week, and i'll see if there's anything specifically we need to develop and go on to.

2181
05:29:07.960 --> 05:29:25.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: So next week we will not. Not. Next week I think it's 2 weeks we'll go free. Some more advanced wrangling and bits and pieces Finish off that worksheet. We'll run through some of this output, you stuff because it's really nice to have a really nice sort of output of whatever you're producing, and if you're going to put it into

2182
05:29:25.850 --> 05:29:36.990
Simon Wellesley-Miller: some sort of bi tool or something, we're cover where today, for more information and next steps, if you want to learn more about our

2183
05:29:37.060 --> 05:29:48.290
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and yeah, and then we just have a any other questions cool. Yeah. Any questions before I drop off for today.

2184
05:29:52.110 --> 05:29:54.200
Simon Wellesley-Miller: or comments, or anything.

2185
05:30:00.230 --> 05:30:02.260
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Death. These silence.

2186
05:30:06.010 --> 05:30:07.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: And now doesn't

2187
05:30:09.660 --> 05:30:13.400
Simon Wellesley-Miller: do we need to do the work from today for next session?

2188
05:30:14.710 --> 05:30:24.090
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Do you want homework, I don't know. I guess if you go, can run through the rest of that document the the code.

2189
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:32.240
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I think that might be helpful, and then we can run through it. If there's any questions or queries, or if anybody got stuck.

2190
05:30:32.580 --> 05:30:50.600
Simon Wellesley-Miller: I think each of the to each of the bits from there on in our self contained. So long as you've run the data at the top, and remember to call some whatever it is, all code you should be able to just run each of the separate sections on their own and and have a play with them.

2191
05:30:50.600 --> 05:30:55.760
Simon Wellesley-Miller: But yeah, we can go through. So yeah, if you if you want to do that homework

2192
05:30:55.880 --> 05:31:08.340
Simon Wellesley-Miller: and then put in the chat or put in the in the smack. If there's any extra bits that you want us to cover. I guess that will give us a bit more time to do other bits if you want to do other bits

2193
05:31:09.870 --> 05:31:13.070
right. I need to

2194
05:31:13.890 --> 05:31:15.270
Simon Wellesley-Miller: get and do some work.

2195
05:31:16.650 --> 05:31:22.680
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Right, let's stop recording, so you can all start swearing at

2196
05:31:24.070 --> 05:31:25.010
Simon Wellesley-Miller: It's not fun.

2197
05:31:39.210 --> 05:31:40.330
Sarah H: I'm done

2198
05:31:40.480 --> 05:31:41.850
Simon Wellesley-Miller: no worries.

2199
05:31:43.050 --> 05:31:45.380
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Thanks, Simon. No problem.

2200
05:31:45.400 --> 05:31:46.650
Rachel: Thank you. Bye, bye.

2201
05:31:46.740 --> 05:31:51.130
Nathan Roberts: thanks very much.

2202
05:31:53.600 --> 05:31:55.830
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Much better than that rubbish prices.

2203
05:31:56.600 --> 05:32:03.530
Simon Wellesley-Miller: Yeah, if I everybody has to get back down, it's like Dan. What we meant. Oh.

2204
05:32:03.770 --> 05:32:04.620
sygal.amitay: bye.

2205
05:32:04.730 --> 05:32:05.700
Simon Wellesley-Miller: this

2206
05:32:05.710 --> 05:32:07.090
Nathan Roberts: a grade

2207
05:32:10.370 --> 05:32:15.440
Simon Wellesley-Miller: perfect. Dan would be very happy, right? All right. I'm off. Thank you very much. Guys.
