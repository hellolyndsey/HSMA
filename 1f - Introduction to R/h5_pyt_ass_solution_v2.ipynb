    "Write a function named `play_mental_game` which takes two inputs - `game_attempts` : an integer representing the number of attempts at the game, and `crystals_collected` : an integer representing the number of crystals the player has collected so far.  The function should randomly choose two numbers between 1 and 10 using the `randint()` method from the `random` library.  Then, a for loop should be constructed that runs for the number of times specified in `game_attempts`.  In each run of the for loop, the computer should ask the user what the answer is to the two numbers randomly chosen being multiplied together (it should print a message to the user with the question too - e.g. `\"What is 4 x 9?\"`).  If the user answers correctly, a message should be displayed saying they got it correct, `crystals_collected` should be incremented by 1 and the the code should break out of the loop.  If the user answers incorrectly, a message should be printed telling them they are incorrect (they will get another go if there are attempts remaining).  At the end of the function, `crystals_collected` should be returned.\n",

The number of silver and gold tickets they collect per 5 seconds (each crystal collected gives them 5 seconds of time) will be random, but also partly based on their level of skill.  Specifically, you know that : a) a low-skill team will collect between 10 and 20 silver tickets and between 5 and 15 gold tickets per 5 seconds, b) a high-skill team will collect between 5 and 30 silver tickets and between 20 and 40 gold tickets per 5 seconds.\n",
